            </h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              I have read several books lately that completely altered my view about the way education systems are designed. 
              I have been familiar with the idea of multiple intelligence since a few years ago but after reading another book by professor Howard Gardner on the topic of intelligence, I became more certain that the issue I noticed in many societies and school systems was real. <br> <br>
              In recent years, I had the opportunity to work with very successful and talented individuals in academia and industrial settings. 
              I realized while those people had outstanding proficiency in their specializations, many of them had severe difficulties in other areas such as interpersonal relationships. 
              Because they focused only on school work and didn't pay enough attention to the other aspects of their lives, they didn't develop their cognitive abilities according to their age and position. 
              Ironically, the problem becomes more visible when they try to apply logic and reasoning in their personal life. 
              Logical fallacies are very common when they make life-changing decisions because their beliefs and emotions take over the rational mind.  <br> <br>
              While the problem would have numerous consequences for a person and society, I think we could easily avoid them.  
              To bypass issues that are caused by illogical thinking we should teach children how to think about their thinking and assess their way of reasoning. 
              The tools to do so are the laws of identity and non-contradiction. The law of identity says things are what they are. 
              A is A. Using the law of identity, causality could be defined. Causality means that things must act following their nature. 
              The law of non-contradiction states that nothing can be A and not A. In other words, nothing can be true and false at the same time.  <br> <br>
              When people lie to themselves, they are violating one of those fundamental laws of logic. There are many forms of logical fallacies that are constructed on top of those basics. 
              Those fallacies include but are not limited to over-generalization, projection, mixing reality with causality, or using correlation for proving an incident was caused by another incident while they had nothing to do with one another. 
              In my opinion, these fundamentals should be taken seriously like teaching language or mathematics. Fundamentals of logic could be much more useful in the life of an individual than, for instance, history or geography.  <br><br>

              Economics is the science that concerns itself with economies. An economy is the large set of inter-related
              production, consumption, and exchange activities that aid in determining how scarce resources are
              allocated.
              Economics is a social science concerned with the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and
              services. It studies how individuals, businesses, governments, and nations make choices about how to
              allocate resources.
              <br><br>
              I believe everyone should be familiar with the basics of economics in the modern societies. I like
              studying
              economics because this knowledge gives you the power to understand how humans or societies deal with each
              other
              over having access and using the scare resources.

              There are many reasons to study psychology, from career prospects to personal interest. Psychology is a
              fascinating area of study.
              It is one of my favorite areas of study that allows me to better understand
              people's intetions, motivations, and needs.
              <br>
              Psychology is the scientific study of the mind and behavior, according to the American Psychological
              Association. Psychology is a multifaceted discipline and includes many sub-fields of study such areas as
              human development, sports, health, clinical, social behavior and cognitive processes. <br><br>
              Here, I would like to discuss some essential and key concepts of Psychology including Personality,
              Learning, Mental
              Development,
              Intelligence, Social Psychology, Biological Psychology, etc. All definitions and theories are extracted
              from reliable scientific
              sources.

              I think philosophy is an activity of mind. Philosophy is what happens when you start thinking for
              yourself. It is a way of thinking about certain sorts
              of question. I like philosophy because it gives me power to have a better understanding of reality and
              helps me to learn how to ask the right questions and how to criticize wrong beliefs.
              <br><br>
              Once one frees oneself from the habits of received belief, those that one
              just happens to have acquired even about basic issues, and really starts to think about what one ought to
              believe, judged by reason (argument) and evidence, then one has started to do philosophy.
              Let's take a look at some important terms and concepts in philosophy from scientific sources.

            <p class="job-description">
              As a Junior Software Engineer and an entry-level employee in a start-up tech company in Silicon Valley, I
              soon realized that what I learned in university is crucial but certainly not enough. Especially, in a
              dynamic and competitive market like software and technology-based jobs, you need to improve your knowledge
              every day no matter how much experience and expertise you have. As it hasn't been a long time since I
              graduated, I still look at myself as a student and have a craving and passion for learning new things.
              Based on my research, there are some topics that you need to know and be a master of as a Software
              Engineer. Those things don't change too often and are the basis of your knowledge. 
              <br><br>
              My list includes the
              following topics. <br><br>
              1. Data Structures and Algorithms<br>
              2. Programming Concepts and Fundamentals<br>
              3. Software Architecture<br>
              4. Software Design Patterns<br>

              In addition to what a Software Engineer should know as the basis of the job, some topics can change quite
              rapidly depending on the growth of technology and its requirements. Therefore, it would be vitally
              important for a professional to understand what subject to pick and how much time to spend to learn a
              specific skill. Keep that in mind technology has always been a tool for humans to achieve their goals and
              satisfy their needs and desires. As societies develop, humans' needs will change, and the previous tools
              become useless or inefficient. 
              <br><br>
              I have a list of tools that need to be updated based on their efficiency
              and compatibility.<br><br>
              1. Programming Languages<br>
              2. Frameworks and Libraries<br>

            <strong> My rating:</strong> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4899106465">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
        
            Why are many of the most successful people plagued by feelings of emptiness and alienation? This wise and profound book has provided thousands of readers with an answer and has helped them to apply it to their own lives.
            Far too many of us had to learn as children to hide our own feelings, needs, and memories skillfully in order to meet our parents’ expectations and win their ”love.”
            <br/><br/><br/>
                <strong>My Review:</strong>
                <br/>
                Children with relatively high intelligence may suffer more during their childhood. 
                As a result, they have to deal with anxiety and depression later and during their adulthood. 
                In this book, Alice Miller explains how sensitive children can damage psychologically by decent parents whose behaviors are quite normal in society. 
                What parents and other caregivers must know is that an infant lives in a totally different world than grown-ups.

                Much of what will happen in the next thirty years is inevitable, driven by technological trends that are already in motion. 
                In this fascinating, provocative new book, Kevin Kelly provides an optimistic road map for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives.
                <br/><br/><br/>
                <strong>My Review:</strong>
                <br/>
                Kevin Kelly is a brilliant and creative author and journalist.
                In this book, he shares his expansive vision and futuristic wisdom about 12 inevitable trends in the world of technology. 
                Kelly points out how robots can change our future in a good way such that people won't have to do dangerous, physical, and difficult tasks because those are done easily by smart robots. 
                Autonomous vehicles will reduce the number of car accidents down to almost zero, and Artificial intelligence will make the healthcare service much more reliable with the help of self-tracking devices (wearables). 
                The emergence of clouds by different companies will create the cloud and every person can carry all human knowledge and information and access it at any time. 
                Of course, he believes modern technology can be used in criminal and non-ethical ways too but the benefits would be in favor of peace and improvement of human lives.

            The Psychology of Silicon Valley offers a revealing look inside the mind of world’s most influential industry and how the identity, culture, myths, and motivations of Big Tech are harming society.             
            <br><br><br><strong>My Review:</strong>
            <br />
            As a software engineer working at a start-up in Silicon Valley, this book gave me valuable insight. The author pays good attention to the psychological issues of the most intelligent and successful individuals in the nation. Lack of emotional intelligence and selfishness cause serious issues in the working environment. Unhealthy competitions demand employees who work like machines with a limited sense of empathy for others. Goal-oriented engineers and self-centered CEOs walk in the streets of the San Francisco Bay Area in front of hundreds of homeless people every day without even noticing them.

              He was told that his problem was caused by a chemical imbalance in his brain. Later he began to investigate this question.           
              Across the world, Hari discovered social scientists who were uncovering the real causes—and they are mostly not in our brains, but in the way we live today.
             
            <br><br><strong>My Review:</strong>
            <br />
            This is an amazing book about human behaviors resulting from our lifestyle that might eventually cause depression in people in the modern world. Studies show that a large number of people, who suffer from depression, have a severe lack of ability to reason and think logically. Hari mentions interesting facts about our animal side and how disconnection from nature can cause depressed moods. Although, in my opinion, the author is a bit too much against medication therapy, some of the topics he says would help people who suffer from depression.

              A psychologist is sent to a station orbiting a distant planet in order to discover what has caused the crew to go insane.             
               <br>
               <br><strong>My Review:</strong><br>
               Solaris is another masterpiece by Tarkovsky and one of the earliest Si-Fi/Drama movies full of artistic scenes and poetic moments. There aren't many directors like Tarkovsky that can capture the deepest human feelings in frames with so few or no words. Solaris, like the other movies by Tarkovsky, has a deep sense of mystery in almost all the scenes, in details, and overall flow of the story. 
               The dialogues and monologues add more sophistication to the scenario and challenge its audience. It surprises you many times, makes you think about knowns and finally leaves you with many philosophical question and unexplored side of your psychee.   <br>
               This film is about love, time, space, the universe, and many other ideas that vaguely exist in our minds. However, they have very different meanings for each person. The psychologist, who is initially going to discover the reason for the mysterious events that happened on that secret planet, like all other individuals who lived there, will eventually be stuck in an infinite loop of his darkest memories. Later, he found some explanations for the issue that was useful enough to free himself but his observations and analysis are not quite meaningful to others who have not been in the same situation.

              A guide leads two men through an area known as the Zone to find a room that grants wishes.
              <br>
              <br><strong>My Review:</strong>
              <br>
              This masterpiece is one of the finest movies of all time about the purpose of life and philosophy of human existence. Three men look for some meaning in a strange and dangerous part of the world. A writer and a professor without knowing each other join the third man, the Stalker, who seems like a loser but he knows something they don't. They follow him to find what they missed in life. Stalker is a mysterious man who spent his life and put a lot of effort into getting to that point and now he has become the guide for others. His wife and child are two other fascinating characters who look even stranger than Stalker himself. The conversation between these three men in the journey makes up the story and artistic shots by Tarkovsky creat a poetic and meaningful stoyline.

              <strong>Abstract: </strong>
              The research community on the study and design of systems for personal informatics has grown over the past
              decade. To take stock of what the topics the field has studied and methods the field has used, we map and
              label
              523 publications from ACM's library, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed. We surface that the literature has focused
              on
              studying and designing for health and wellness domains, an emphasis on understanding and overcoming
              barriers
              to
              data collection and reflection, and progressively fewer contributions involving artifacts being made. Our
              mapping review suggests directions future research could explore, such as identifying and resolving
              barriers
              to
              tracking stages beyond collection and reflection, engaging more with domain experts, and further
              discussing
              the
              privacy and ethical concerns around tracked data.
