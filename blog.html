            <p class="job-description">
              Today, I was listening to Radio Hamrah when a young woman called to ask about her marriage, and how her
              partner insisted on a prenup. For those who don't know, a prenuptial agreement, commonly referred to as a
              prenup, is a written contract you and your spouse enter into before getting legally married. It details
              exactly what happens to finances and assets during your marriage and, of course, in
              the event of divorce.
              Although in some cases, a prenup can help, most of the time can be destructive. The funny thing is that
              those people don't understand that by marrying someone they share their life with someone, their children,
              and their moments. All the moments that could potentially hurt them. The question is "Why do you trust to
              share your life with someone, while
              you cannot share your property with them?"
              We as humans, like other animals have needs that should be satisfied, especially as Mazlo pointed out, our
              physiological needs are essential for our being. The second level is related to security and safety.
              If you satisfied those needs you can go to upper levels like love and belongings, self-esteem, and so on.
              Finally, you get to the point that
              satisfying the need is not essential for being but it improves the state of your well-being or becoming.
              Only the first level is about owning things, and you can satisfy your security need by owning more
              material. Self-actualization is the highest level that you and only you are worth. You think about
              yourself as something far more valuable than materials like your house, car, etc. We can simply understand
              that the person who does not pass the second level can not be in a state that can love and be loved.
              Although many of them do not agree with that. However, if you cannot trust someone with your money, your
              marriage is not at the third level and about love. You see your partner as an object to become more secure
              by having them. Such people have very low self-esteem. They don't love themselves and cannot believe that
              someone can love them because, in their point of view, they are worthless. Nobody. Nothing. Therefore, if
              someone comes close to them, it must be about what they own. <br><br>

            </h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Since the summer of 2015, when I moved to California from Europe, I have moved into different homes
              several times. Almost every year, I had to change my place, and although I didn't own so much stuff, I was
              stressed out each time that I was supposed to move to a different house. I had to spend a lot of my time
              packing my thing and being worried about the big moving day.
              In my last move from Irvine to Sacramento, I decided to keep the things I need and get rid of the extra
              and unnecessary items. Later I became interested in learning about minimalism philosophy and lifestyle.
              As a minimalist, I can say I am at the starting point of my journey to
              live a simpler and happier life.
              So, what is minimalism anyway?
              There is no right or wrong answer to this question. Everyone has own interpretation of this concept.
              However, I define minimalism such that as a minimalist,
              I am removing the distraction of excess possessions so I can focus more on those things that matter most.
              Minimalism is all about freedom.
              Minimalism isn't an end point.
              It's a constant process of editing, revisiting,
              editing some more. <br><br>

            <p class="job-description">
              Economics is the science that concerns itself with economies. An economy is the large set of inter-related
              production, consumption, and exchange activities that aid in determining how scarce resources are
              allocated.
              Economics is a social science concerned with the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and
              services. It studies how individuals, businesses, governments, and nations make choices about how to
              allocate resources.
              <br><br>
              I believe everyone should be familiar with the basics of economics in the modern societies. I like
              studying
              economics because this knowledge gives you the power to understand how humans or societies deal with each
              other
              over having access and using the scare resources.

              There are many reasons to study psychology, from career prospects to personal interest. Psychology is a
              fascinating area of study.
              It is one of my favorite areas of study that allows me to better understand
              people's intetions, motivations, and needs.
              <br>
              Psychology is the scientific study of the mind and behavior, according to the American Psychological
              Association. Psychology is a multifaceted discipline and includes many sub-fields of study such areas as
              human development, sports, health, clinical, social behavior and cognitive processes. <br><br>
              Here, I would like to discuss some essential and key concepts of Psychology including Personality,
              Learning, Mental
              Development,
              Intelligence, Social Psychology, Biological Psychology, etc. All definitions and theories are extracted
              from reliable scientific
              sources.

              I think philosophy is an activity of mind. Philosophy is what happens when you start thinking for
              yourself. It is a way of thinking about certain sorts
              of question. I like philosophy because it gives me power to have a better understanding of reality and
              helps me to learn how to ask the right questions and how to criticize wrong beliefs.
              <br><br>
              Once one frees oneself from the habits of received belief, those that one
              just happens to have acquired even about basic issues, and really starts to think about what one ought to
              believe, judged by reason (argument) and evidence, then one has started to do philosophy.
              Let's take a look at some important terms and concepts in philosophy from scientific sources.

            <p class="job-description">
              As a Junior Software Engineer and an entry-level employee in a start-up tech company in Silicon Valley, I
              soon realized that what I learned in university is crucial but certainly not enough. Especially, in a
              dynamic and competitive market like software and technology-based jobs, you need to improve your knowledge
              every day no matter how much experience and expertise you have. As it hasn't been a long time since I
              graduated, I still look at myself as a student and have a craving and passion for learning new things.
              Based on my research, there are some topics that you need to know and be a master of as a Software
              Engineer. Those things don't change too often and are the basis of your knowledge. 
              <br><br>
              My list includes the
              following topics. <br><br>
              1. Data Structures and Algorithms<br>
              2. Programming Concepts and Fundamentals<br>
              3. Software Architecture<br>
              4. Software Design Patterns<br>

              In addition to what a Software Engineer should know as the basis of the job, some topics can change quite
              rapidly depending on the growth of technology and its requirements. Therefore, it would be vitally
              important for a professional to understand what subject to pick and how much time to spend to learn a
              specific skill. Keep that in mind technology has always been a tool for humans to achieve their goals and
              satisfy their needs and desires. As societies develop, humans' needs will change, and the previous tools
              become useless or inefficient.

              I have a list of tools that need to be updated based on their efficiency
              and compatibility.<br><br>

            The Psychology of Silicon Valley offers a revealing look inside the mind of world’s most influential industry and how the identity, culture, myths, and motivations of Big Tech are harming society.             
            <br><br><br><strong>My Review:</strong>
            <br />
            As a software engineer working at a start-up in Silicon Valley, this book gave me valuable insight. The author pays good attention to the psychological issues of the most intelligent and successful individuals in the nation. Lack of emotional intelligence and selfishness cause serious issues in the working environment. Unhealthy competitions demand employees who work like machines with a limited sense of empathy for others. Goal-oriented engineers and self-centered CEOs walk in the streets of the San Francisco Bay Area in front of hundreds of homeless people every day without even noticing them.

              by Johann Hari</a><br/>
              <strong> My rating:</strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4112921408"> 5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
              Award-winning journalist Johann Hari suffered from depression since he was a teenager.
              He was told that his problem was caused by a chemical imbalance in his brain. Later he began to investigate this question.           
              Across the world, Hari discovered social scientists who were uncovering the real causes—and they are mostly not in our brains, but in the way we live today.
             
            <br><br><strong>My Review:</strong>
            <br />
            This is an amazing book about human behaviors resulting from our lifestyle that might eventually cause depression in people in the modern world. Studies show that a large number of people, who suffer from depression, have a severe lack of ability to reason and think logically. Hari mentions interesting facts about our animal side and how disconnection from nature can cause depressed moods. Although, in my opinion, the author is a bit too much against medication therapy, some of the topics he says would help people who suffer from depression.

              Decision-making is one of the most critical functions of our mind. In this book, the authors clearly show
              how peoples' minds are programmed. The whole idea of algorithm design is about how our minds process and
              the steps we use to overcome challenges. Psychology explains how humans' minds operate when it comes to
              tasks that are difficult but common. We need to solve a problem once by finding the proper steps, remember
              them, and use them any time we face the same or similar problems. This idea is how computers work.
              Computers are programmed to make our life easier by completing tasks faster as a result of the combination
              of the power of the mind and the functionality of microprocessors that use with multiple levels of
              software. Authors go over the most crucial concepts of data structures and algorithms like searching,
              sorting, optimizing, graphs, etc., and show how such ideas were born.
              Although the literature is fairly simple, smooth, and does not include too many technical words and
              phrases, its concepts can be somehow difficult for readers with no or limited background in computer
              science and mathematics.

              A psychologist is sent to a station orbiting a distant planet in order to discover what has caused the crew to go insane.             
               <br>
               <br><strong>My Review:</strong><br>
               Solaris is another masterpiece by Tarkovsky and one of the earliest Si-Fi/Drama movies full of artistic scenes and poetic moments. There aren't many directors like Tarkovsky that can capture the deepest human feelings in frames with so few or no words. Solaris, like the other movies by Tarkovsky, has a deep sense of mystery in almost all the scenes, in details, and overall flow of the story. 
               The dialogues and monologues add more sophistication to the scenario and challenge its audience. It surprises you many times, makes you think about knowns and finally leaves you with many philosophical question and unexplored side of your psychee.   <br>
               This film is about love, time, space, the universe, and many other ideas that vaguely exist in our minds. However, they have very different meanings for each person. The psychologist, who is initially going to discover the reason for the mysterious events that happened on that secret planet, like all other individuals who lived there, will eventually be stuck in an infinite loop of his darkest memories. Later, he found some explanations for the issue that was useful enough to free himself but his observations and analysis are not quite meaningful to others who have not been in the same situation.

              A guide leads two men through an area known as the Zone to find a room that grants wishes.
              <br>
              <br><strong>My Review:</strong>
              <br>
              This masterpiece is one of the finest movies of all time about the purpose of life and philosophy of human existence. Three men look for some meaning in a strange and dangerous part of the world. A writer and a professor without knowing each other join the third man, the Stalker, who seems like a loser but he knows something they don't. They follow him to find what they missed in life. Stalker is a mysterious man who spent his life and put a lot of effort into getting to that point and now he has become the guide for others. His wife and child are two other fascinating characters who look even stranger than Stalker himself. The conversation between these three men in the journey makes up the story and artistic shots by Tarkovsky creat a poetic and meaningful stoyline.

              <strong>Abstract: </strong>
              The research community on the study and design of systems for personal informatics has grown over the past
              decade. To take stock of what the topics the field has studied and methods the field has used, we map and
              label
              523 publications from ACM's library, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed. We surface that the literature has focused
              on
              studying and designing for health and wellness domains, an emphasis on understanding and overcoming
              barriers
              to
              data collection and reflection, and progressively fewer contributions involving artifacts being made. Our
              mapping review suggests directions future research could explore, such as identifying and resolving
              barriers
              to
              tracking stages beyond collection and reflection, engaging more with domain experts, and further
              discussing
              the
              privacy and ethical concerns around tracked data.
