            </h3>
            <p class="p-description">
              October 22nd, 2022, was the day that Berlin witnessed around eighty thousand protesters who marched to show their support for the most expansive uprising against the Islamic government that has ruled Iran since the 1979 revolution (DW 2022). 
              More than 43 years ago, Iranians overthrew a modern westernized autocracy, and 2500 years of Persian monarchy began with the Achaemenid Empire and Ended with the Pahlavi Dynasty. 
              Since protests broke out on September 16th in Tehran — after Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman was arrested by the police because of her improper hijab and brutally murdered while in custody — many Iranians have joined the uprising in different cities inside the country. 
              From that day forward, many individuals, including public figures, have shown their support and empathy worldwide. Among those are Iranian and non-Iranian artists, scientists, politicians, human rights activists, and millions of Iranians who had no alternative but to leave the country after the Islamic Revolution. 
              As a result of the intensity and persistency of the events, the uprising gave birth to a revolutionary movement. Women, Life, Liberty is the signature of this innovative movement with unique features centered on human dignity, individual freedoms, and women's rights.
             <br> <br>
             Social movements occur when there are underlying social problems, such that it becomes the widespread belief that the existing condition is harmful. 
             De Fronzo (2019) defines a social movement as a continuous and organized effort involving the mobilization of large groups of individuals that cooperate to bring about what they believe to be beneficial social change or resist or reverse what they believe to be harmful social change. 
             Sociologists have various theories about why social movements begin, but the most widespread one is the deprivation theory. Deprivation theory has two forms. 
             Absolute deprivation is associated mainly with physical needs and when people cannot obtain adequate food, shelter, and so on, while relative deprivation results from comparison and inequality. 
             Revolutionary movements seem to develop not just because of deprivation or inequality but because of expectations and moral beliefs about justice and fairness (De Fronzo 2019). 
             Therefore, when a considerable number of individuals feel some degree of dissatisfaction with various aspects of their day-to-day lives, when minor uprisings initiate, more people become convinced that change is necessary and feasible. 
             Hence, they will be motivated to join the protesters. As the participation advance and persist, if there are clear objectives in the words and minds of the protesters, their actions will shape a movement.

            <p class="p-description">
            by Abbas Milani</a><br/>
                
            <strong> My rating:</strong> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4955437570">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
        
            Here, internationally respected author Abbas Milani gives us the definitive biography, more than ten years in the making, of the monarch who shaped Iran's modern age and with it the contemporary politics of the Middle East.
                <br/><br/><br/>
                <strong>My Review:</strong>
                <br/>
                Dr. Milani is an outstanding scholar and Iranian professor at Stanford University. 
                In this book, he authors a detailed and analytical biography of the last monarch of Iran who had to flee the country after the government's overthrow in 1979 which led to the Islamic Revolution in Iran. 
                Milani carefully describes the story from different perspectives and based on reliable sources and has a fair attitude for admiring or criticizing the Shah's actions as a head of state for 37 years. 
                This book narrates the public and personal life of the Shah in parallel so the readers have a better understanding of the Shah's situations at critical points during his reign.

              <p class="p-description">
            by Alice Miller</a><br/>

            <strong> My rating:</strong> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4899106465">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
        
            Why are many of the most successful people plagued by feelings of emptiness and alienation? This wise and profound book has provided thousands of readers with an answer and has helped them to apply it to their own lives.
            Far too many of us had to learn as children to hide our own feelings, needs, and memories skillfully in order to meet our parents’ expectations and win their ”love.”
            <br/><br/><br/>
                <strong>My Review:</strong>
                <br/>
                Children with relatively high intelligence may suffer more during their childhood. 
                As a result, they have to deal with anxiety and depression later and during their adulthood. 
                In this book, Alice Miller explains how sensitive children can damage psychologically by decent parents whose behaviors are quite normal in society. 
                What parents and other caregivers must know is that an infant lives in a totally different world than grown-ups.

            by Kevin Kelly</a><br/>
            <strong> My rating:</strong> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4955437570">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
        
            
                Much of what will happen in the next thirty years is inevitable, driven by technological trends that are already in motion. 
                In this fascinating, provocative new book, Kevin Kelly provides an optimistic road map for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives.
                <br/><br/><br/>
                <strong>My Review:</strong>
                <br/>
                Kevin Kelly is a brilliant and creative author and journalist.
                In this book, he shares his expansive vision and futuristic wisdom about 12 inevitable trends in the world of technology. 
                Kelly points out how robots can change our future in a good way such that people won't have to do dangerous, physical, and difficult tasks because those are done easily by smart robots. 
                Autonomous vehicles will reduce the number of car accidents down to almost zero, and Artificial intelligence will make the healthcare service much more reliable with the help of self-tracking devices (wearables). 
                The emergence of clouds by different companies will create the cloud and every person can carry all human knowledge and information and access it at any time. 
                Of course, he believes modern technology can be used in criminal and non-ethical ways too but the benefits would be in favor of peace and improvement of human lives.

              Two young Swedish children in the 1900s experience the many comedies and tragedies of their lively and affectionate theatrical family, the Ekdahls.
               <br>
               <br><strong>My Review:</strong><br>
               Like its title, the film is about the life of a brother and sister at a very young age. 
               In its first hour, Bergman takes you to the mysterious life of a wealthy family that owns a theatre at Christmastime. 
               Alexander and Fanny lived in a colorful house with caring parents Emilie and Oscar and their grandparents, uncles, and workers until Oscar died unexpectedly. 
               As a result, Emilie thinks she needs support from a strong man to raise her children and marries a cold and prejudiced bishop who brutally abuses her kids and herself. 
               Bergman made this film based on the true story of his life. In his film, he reveals the contrast between the life of the two groups and uses every element to highlight his points. 
               The furniture and interior design of the two homes would tell you much more than anything else about the feeling and beliefs of the residents. 
               The dialogues are written carefully and adapted to characters and situations.

              A psychologist is sent to a station orbiting a distant planet in order to discover what has caused the crew to go insane.             

               <br>
               <br><strong>My Review:</strong><br>
               Solaris is another masterpiece by Tarkovsky and one of the earliest Si-Fi/Drama movies full of artistic scenes and poetic moments. There aren't many directors like Tarkovsky that can capture the deepest human feelings in frames with so few or no words. Solaris, like the other movies by Tarkovsky, has a deep sense of mystery in almost all the scenes, in details, and overall flow of the story. 
               The dialogues and monologues add more sophistication to the scenario and challenge its audience. It surprises you many times, makes you think about knowns and finally leaves you with many philosophical question and unexplored side of your psychee.   <br>
               This film is about love, time, space, the universe, and many other ideas that vaguely exist in our minds. However, they have very different meanings for each person. The psychologist, who is initially going to discover the reason for the mysterious events that happened on that secret planet, like all other individuals who lived there, will eventually be stuck in an infinite loop of his darkest memories. Later, he found some explanations for the issue that was useful enough to free himself but his observations and analysis are not quite meaningful to others who have not been in the same situation.
