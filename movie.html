              A psychologist is sent to a station orbiting a distant planet in order to discover what has caused the crew to go insane.             
               <br><br>
               Solaris is another masterpiece by Tarkovsky and one of the earliest Si-Fi/Drama movies full of artistic scenes and poetic moments. There aren't many directors like Tarkovsky that can capture the deepest human feelings in frames with so few or no words. Solaris, like the other movies by Tarkovsky, has a deep sense of mystery in almost all the scenes, in details, and overall flow of the story. 
               The dialogues and monologues add more sophistication to the scenario and challenge its audience. It surprises you many times, makes you think about knowns and finally leaves you with many philosophical question and unexplored side of your psychee.   <br>
               This film is about love, time, space, the universe, and many other ideas that vaguely exist in our minds. However, they have very different meanings for each person. The psychologist, who is initially going to discover the reason for the mysterious events that happened on that secret planet, like all other individuals who lived there, will eventually be stuck in an infinite loop of his darkest memories. Later, he found some explanations for the issue that was useful enough to free himself but his observations and analysis are not quite meaningful to others who have not been in the same situation.

              A woman struggles to find a way to live her life after the death of her husband and child. <br><br>
              Blue is the color of sadness and comfort. The movie starts with the creation of a disaster in a woman's
              life. When she wakes up in hospital she realizes she lost her husband and child. This is the beginning of
              a tough experience with lots of struggles in her thoughts. Julie who was the wife of a famous musician

              After his wife divorces him, a Polish immigrant plots to get even with her.
              <br><br>
              I think the openning and closing of this film is the best between all three the way that the author/director surprises the audience with unusual and uncanny shots.
              The film starts with showing a suitcase in the airport, then shifts to a Paris divorce court where a Polish barber is talking with the judge similar to a scene in Blue. 
              After a series of events after the divorce, the guy who was an immigrant in Paris with no money, comes back to Poland his home country for the sake of survival.
              Sometime later, the camera shows the guy, who now became a successful person in France, visits his ex-wife in prison and sees her through her cell window. 
              As she gestures to him that she wants him back, the guy starts to cry like a lost child who just found his mother.
