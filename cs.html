            In computer programming, a variable or scalar is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name,
            which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value.
            Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. It is
            helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information.

            A variable's scope determines where in a program a variable is available for use. A variable's scope is
            defined by where the variable is initialized or created. There are two types of scope.
            A variable declared outside a function, becomes Global.
            A global variable has global scope: All scripts and functions can access it.
            Variables declared within a function, become Local to the function.
            Local variables have Function scope: They can only be accessed from within the function.

          <h3 class="mb-0">Data Types</h3>
          <p class="job-description">
            When computer programs store data in variables, each variable must be assigned a specific data type. Some
            common data types include integers, floating point numbers, characters, strings, and arrays. They may also
            be more specific types, such as dates, timestamps, boolean values, and varchar (variable character) formats.
            Some programming languages require the programmer to define the data type of a variable before assigning it
            a value. Other languages can automatically assign a variable's data type when the initial data is entered
            into the variable.

          <p class="job-description">

            A debugger is a tool which controls the execution of the program you’re working on. It
            controls and keeps track of all variables and procedure parameters, etc. as the program is running. It
            is a second pair of eyes on your code to highlight errors and to avoid potential program crashes such
            as zero division, illegal array offset access and data overflow errors. The program execution can
            be stopped and forwarded step by step to locate any faults or strange behavior. This can be very useful
            especially if a program falls into an endless loop or you are unsure of what value a particular variable
            holds at any given time.

          <p class="job-description">
            A compiler is a computer program that transforms code written in a high-level programming language into the
            machine code. It is a program which translates the human-readable code to a language a computer processor
            understands (binary 1 and 0 bits). The computer processes the machine code to perform the corresponding
            tasks. A compiler should comply with the syntax rule of that programming language in which it is written.
            However, the compiler is only a program and cannot fix errors found in that program. So, if you make a
            mistake, you need to make changes in the syntax of your program. Otherwise, it will not compile.

            which is converting higher level programming language to machine code. However, a compiler will convert the
            code into machine code (create an exe) before program run. Interpreters convert code into machine code when

            left-to-right scan, lexical analysis does not distinguish between identifiers that are
            names of
            variables and identifiers that are names of constants. Because variables and constants are declared
            differently,
            variables and constants are distinguished in the semantic analysis phase.

            parsing. The purpose of parsing is to produce a data structure called a parse tree,

            the place in
            the program where each identifier is declared.
            Compiler writers use the word semantic because this
            phase
            relies on context information, and the kind of grammar used for syntactic analysis does not capture context

            approach to solve problem using some programming language or also we can say it is a method to solve a
            problem using tools and techniques that are available to us following some approach.

          <h3 class="mb-0">Imperative Programming Paradigm</h3>
          <p class="job-description">
            It is based on Von Neumann architecture. It works by changing the program state through assignment
            statements. It performs step by step task by changing state. The main focus is on how to achieve the goal.
            Imperative programming is divided into three broad categories: Procedural, OOP and parallel processing.
            <br><br>
            Procedural Programming Paradigm:<br>
            This paradigm emphasizes on procedure in terms of under lying machine model.
            Examples of Procedural programming paradigm: C, C++, Java <br><br>
            Object Oriented Programming:<br>
            The program is written as a collection of classes and object which are meant for communication. The smallest
            and basic entity is object and all kind of computation is performed on the objects only. More emphasis is on
            data rather procedure.
            Examples of Object Oriented programming paradigm: Java, C++, Objective-C, Visual Basic .NET, Python, Ruby
            <br><br>
            Parallel Processing Approach:<br>
            Parallel processing is the processing of program instructions by dividing them among multiple processors.
            This approach seems to be like divide and conquer. Examples are NESL and C/C++

          <h3 class="mb-0">Declarative Programming Paradigm</h3>
          <p class="job-description">

            It is divided as Logic, Functional, Database. In computer science the declarative programming is a style of
            building programs that expresses logic of computation without talking about its control flow. The focus is
            on what
            needs to be done rather how it should be done basically emphasize on what code code is actually doing. It
            just declare the result we want rather how it has be produced. <br><br>
            Logic Programming Paradigms:<br>
            It can be termed as abstract model of computation. It would solve logical problems like puzzles, series etc.
            In logical programming the main emphasize is on knowledge base and the problem. The execution of the program
            is very much like proof of mathematical statement, e.g., Prolog. <br><br>
            Functional Programming Paradigms:<br>
            The functional programming paradigms has its roots in mathematics and it is language independent. The key
            principal of this paradigms is the execution of series of mathematical functions.
            Function can be replaced with their values without changing the meaning of the program.
            Examples of Functional programming paradigm: JavaScript, Haskwell, Scala, Perl. <br><br>

            Database Programming Approach:<br>
            This programming methodology is based on data and its movement. Program statements are defined by data
            rather than hard-coding a series of steps.
            There are several programming languages that are developed mostly for database application. For example SQL.
            It is applied to streams of structured data, for filtering, transforming, aggregating, or calling other
            programs.

            A queue is a useful data structure in programming. It is similar to the ticket queue outside a cinema hall.
            <br>
            Queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) rule - the item that goes in first is the item that comes out
            first.<br>
            In programming terms, putting items in the queue is called enqueue, and removing items from the queue is
            called dequeue.<br>
            There are four different types of queues:<br>
            - Simple Queue<br>
            - Circular Queue<br>
            - Priority Queue<br>

            Full Binary Tree<br>
            A full Binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two
            or no children.<br><br>
            Perfect Binary Tree<br>
            A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes and

            Complete Binary Tree<br>
            A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences<br>
            1. Every level must be completely filled<br>
            2. All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.<br>
            3. The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. a complete binary tree doesn't have to be a
            full
            binary tree.<br><br>
            Degenerate or Pathological Tree<br>
            A degenerate or pathological tree is the tree having a single child either left or right.<br><br>
            Skewed Binary Tree<br>
            A skewed binary tree is a pathological/degenerate tree in which the tree is either dominated by the left
            nodes or the right nodes. Thus, there are two types of skewed binary tree: left-skewed binary tree and
            right-skewed binary tree.<br><br>
            Balanced Binary Tree<br>
            It is a type of binary tree in which the difference between the left and the right subtree for each node is
            either 0 or 1.<br><br>
            Binary Tree Representation<br>
            A node of a binary tree is represented by a structure containing a data part and two pointers to other
            structures of the same type.

            AVL tree got its name after its inventor Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Landis.<br><br>
            Balance Factor<br>
            Balance factor of a node in an AVL tree is the difference between the height of the left subtree and that of
            the right subtree of that node.<br>
            Balance Factor = (Height of Left Subtree - Height of Right Subtree) or (Height of Right Subtree - Height of
            Left Subtree)<br><br>
            The self balancing property of an avl tree is maintained by the balance factor. The value of balance factor
            should always be -1, 0 or +1.

            B-tree is a special type of self-balancing search tree in which each node can contain more than one key and
            can have more than two children. It is a generalized form of the binary search tree.<br>
            The need for B-tree arose with the rise in the need for lesser time in accessing the physical storage media
            like a hard disk. The secondary storage devices are slower with a larger capacity. There was a need for such
            types of data structures that minimize the disk accesses.<br>
            Other data structures such as a binary search tree, avl tree, etc can store only one key in
            one node. If you have to store a large number of keys, then the height of such trees becomes very large and
            the access time increases.<br>
            However, B-tree can store many keys in a single node and can have multiple child nodes. This decreases the
            height significantly allowing faster disk accesses.

            in which the algorithm works i.e. by starting from the base case and working towards the solution, we can
            also implement dynamic programming in a bottom-up manner.

          <h3 class="mb-0">Recursion vs Dynamic Programming</h3>
          <p class="job-description">
            Dynamic programming is mostly applied to recursive algorithms. This is not a coincidence, most optimization
            problems require recursion and dynamic programming is used for optimization.<br>
            But not all problems that use recursion can use Dynamic Programming. Unless there is a presence of
            overlapping subproblems like in the fibonacci sequence problem, a recursion can only reach the solution
            using a divide and conquer approach.<br>
            That is the reason why a recursive algorithm like Merge Sort cannot use Dynamic Programming, because the
            subproblems are not overlapping in any way.

          <h3 class="mb-0">Greedy Algorithms vs Dynamic Programming</h3>
          <p class="job-description">
            Greedy Algorithms are similar to dynamic programming in the sense that they are both tools for
            optimization.<br>
            However, greedy algorithms look for locally optimum solutions or in other words, a greedy choice, in the
            hopes of finding a global optimum. Hence greedy algorithms can make a guess that looks optimum at the time
            but becomes costly down the line and do not guarantee a globally optimum.<br>
            Dynamic programming, on the other hand, finds the optimal solution to subproblems and then makes an informed
            choice to combine the results of those subproblems to find the most optimum solution.

            the

            Back-end, front-end, and full-stack web development are three separate career paths that can sometimes feel
            muddied in the technology space. Back-end developers are focused on data, modeling, and the
            back end of a website. Front-end developers help build what users interact with and see. A full-stack

            Front-end or clinet-side development is all about designing the surface level of applications by changing
            their style and
            appearance to meet the needs of the user or customer. To put it simply, the front end manages the parts of
            websites and applications that users actually see and interact with to perform certain tasks.

            Still, there is a lot more to the back end than just controlling the overall functionality of an app or a
            website. It also details what happens on the server and database.

            Responsive web design is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices
            and window or screen sizes.<br>
            The practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media
            queries. <br> As the user switches from their laptop to iPad, the website should automatically switch to
            accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abilities. <br>
            responsive Web design is not only about adjustable screen resolutions and automatically resizable images,
            but rather about a whole new way of thinking about design.

          <h3 class="mb-0"> Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design</h3>
          <p class="job-description">
            Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design are called "heuristics" because they are
            broad rules of thumb and not specific usability guidelines. <br>
            1. Visibility of system status <br>
            The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through
            appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time. <br>
            2. Match between system and the real world <br>
            The design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather
            than internal jargon. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical
            order. <br>
            3. User control and freedom <br>
            Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted
            action without having to go through an extended process. <br>
            4. Consistency and standards <br>
            Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow
            platform and industry conventions. <br>
            5. Error prevention <br>
            Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the
            first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions, or check for them and present users with a
            confirmation option before they commit to the action. <br>
            6. Recognition rather than recall <br>
            Minimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. The user should not have
            to remember information from one part of the interface to another. Information required to use the design
            should be visible or easily retrievable when needed. <br>
            7. Flexibility and efficiency of use <br>
            Shortcuts — hidden from novice users — may speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the design
            can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.
            8. Aesthetic and minimalist design <br>
            Interfaces should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of
            information in an interface competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative
            visibility. <br>
            9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors <br>
            Error messages should be expressed in plain language, precisely indicate the problem, and
            constructively suggest a solution. <br>
            10. Help and documentation <br>
            It’s best if the system doesn’t need any additional explanation. However, it may be necessary to provide
            documentation to help users understand how to complete their tasks.

            Data independence refers to the immunity of user applications to changes made in the definition and

            system data descriptions or data describing data (metadata) are separated from the application programs.
            This is possible

            A schema is an overall description of a database, and it is usually represented by the entity relationship
            diagram (ERD).
            There are many subschemas that represent external models and thus display external views of the data

            Provide concepts that are close to the way people perceive data to present the data. A typical example
            of this type is the entity relationship model which uses main concepts like entities, attributes,
            relationships.
            An entity represents a real-world object such as an employee, a project. An entity has some attributes which
            represents properties of entity such as employee’s name, address, birthdate. A relationship represents an
            association among entities, for example an employee works on many projects. The relationship exists between
            employee and project.

            Designing different types of databases lie at the core of the functionality that they provide to the users.
            Since data is a dynamic entity, the way it is stored varies a lot. It is also the reason behind companies
            designing their own types of databases that comply with their needs.
            Here are some popular types of databases:<br> <br>

            - Hierarchical databases <br>
            - Network databases <br>
            - Object-oriented databases <br>

          <p class="job-description">
            Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed
            to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits
            traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.
            In general terms, AI refers to a broad
            field of science encompassing not only
            computer science but also psychology,
            philosophy, linguistics and other areas.

          <p class="job-description">
            Artificial Intelligence term was coined by
            John McCarthy in 1956. He defined it as "the science
            and engineering of making intelligent machines.”

          <p class="job-description">

            Machine learning is the process whereby
            a computer distills meaning by exposure
            to training data. If for example you want
            an algorithm to identify spam in e-mails,
            you will have to train the algorithm by
            exposing it to many examples of e-mails
            that are manually labeled as being spam or
            not-spam. The algorithm “learns” to identify
            patterns, like occurrence of certain words
            or combination of words, that determines
            the chance of an e-mail being spam.
            Machine learning can be applied to many
            different problems and data sets.

            Cognitive Analytics is a subset of A.I.
            that deals with cognitive behavior we
            associate with ‘thinking’ as opposed to
            perception and motor control. Thinking
            allows an entity to obtain information from
            observations, learn and communicate. A cognitive system is capable of extracting
            information from unstructured data by
            extracting concepts and relationships into
            a knowledge base. F

          <p class="job-description">

            A chess computer could beat a human
            in playing chess, but it couldn’t solve a
            complex math problem. Virtually all current
            AI is “narrow”, meaning it can only do what
            it is designed for. This means for every
            problem, a specific algorithm needs to be
            designed to solve it. Narrow AI are mostly
            much better at the task they were made for
            than humans, like face recognition, chess
            computers, calculus, translation. The holy
            grail of AI is a General AI, a single system
            that can learn about any problem and then
            solve it. This is exactly what humans do:
            we can specialize in a specific topic, from
            abstract maths to psychology and from
            sports to art, we can become experts at all
            of them.
