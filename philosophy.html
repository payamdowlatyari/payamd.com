            <p class="job-description">
              If you look in the dictionary you will discover that the term philosophy is derived from two Greek words
              that mean “the love of wisdom.” Philosophy, then, has
              something to do with wisdom, but wisdom is also a term that a lot of people use
              without knowing exactly what they mean by it. <br>
              When the ancient Greek thinkers
              referred to wisdom, they usually meant the knowledge of fundamental principles
              and laws, an awareness of that which was basic and unchanging, as opposed to
              those things that are transitory and changing. <br>Ever since then, the term philosophy
              has taken on something of this meaning and refers to attempts on the part of serious thinkers to get at
              the basis of things. Not the superficial, trivial details, but the
              underlying fundamentals.

            <h3 class="mb-0">History of Philosophy</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Philosophy has been around since the dawn of western civilization. The golden age of Greek philosophy took
              place in Athens in the 5th century BC.
              The history of philosophy is a
              fascinating and important
              subject in its own right, and many of the classic philosophical texts
              are also great works of literature. <br> Starting at the height of the Roman republic, Christian thought
              was central to philosophy at least until the enlightenment. In the 18th century, questions of how we come
              to know what we believe we know (epistemology), and new ethical schools began to form. By the late 1800’s,
              questions of language, logic, and meaning took center stage, and the 20th century played host to one of
              the largest bursts of philosophical work ever seen. Today philosophical thought is applied to almost every
              component of life, from science to warfare, politics to artificial intelligence.

            <p class="job-description">
              Philosophical questions (unlike those of the sciences) are usually foundational and abstract in nature.
              Although the study of philosophy may not yield "the meaning of life, the universe and everything", many
              philosophers believe that it is important that each of us examines such questions and even that an
              unexamined life is not worth living. It also provides a good way of learning to think more clearly about a
              wide range of issues, and its methods of analyzing arguments can be useful in a variety of situations in
              other areas of life.

            <p class="job-description">
              Philosophy is what happens when you start thinking for yourself.
              Once one frees oneself from the habits of received belief, those that one
              just happens to have acquired even about basic issues, and really starts to think about what one ought to
              believe, judged by reason (argument) and evidence, then one has started to do philosophy.

            <p class="job-description">
              The primary value of philosophy according to Bertrand Russell is that it loosens the grip of uncritically
              held opinion and opens the mind to a liberating range of new possibilities to explore.
              He states,
              "It greatly increases our knowledge as to what they may be; it removes the
              somewhat arrogant dogmatism of those who have never traveled into the region of
              liberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familiar things in an
              unfamiliar aspect".

            <h3 class="mb-0">Beyond The Factual </h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Philosophy is not usually concerned with gathering facts.
              The reason for this is twofold. First,
              philosophy
              usually deals with matters that have to be assumed in gathering the facts – questions about truth and
              the know ability of reality, for example. Any attempt to solve the philosophical problems by reference
              to the facts is therefore highly likely to be question begging.
              We cannot for example refer to the evidence gathered through perception about the world to solve the
              philosophical problem of what can be known, if anything, about the world through perception. Second,
              the facts are usually insufﬁcient to deal with the philosophical problem.

            <h3 class="mb-0">Timelessness of Philosophical Problems</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              It is not uncontentious to say that philosophical problems are timeless. To some it looks like an excuse
              for examining problems which in fact can have no answer because thereis something wrong in considering
              them as ‘problems’ in the first place. However, the subject of philosophy certainly acts as if
              philosophical problems are timeless.

            <p class="job-description">
              Closely related to a definition is the effort by philosophers to analyze the meanings of a
              word in order to verify some of these meanings while discarding others.
              Philosophical analysis refers to a set of techniques, typically used by philosophers in the analytic
              tradition, in order to "break down" philosophical issues.

              Metaphysical issues are concerned with the nature of reality. Traditional metaphysical issues
              include the existence of God and the nature of human free will (assuming we have any). Here are
              a few metaphysical questions of interest to contemporary philosophers: <br>What is a thing? <br>How are
              space and time related? <br>Does the past exist? <br>How about the future? <br>How many dimensions does
              the world have? <br>Are there any entities beyond physical objects (like numbers, properties, and

              Epistemology is concerned with the nature of knowledge and justified belief. <br> What is
              knowledge? <br> Can we have any knowledge at all? <br> Can we have knowledge about the laws of
              nature, the laws or morality, or the existence of other minds? <br> The view that we can’t have
              knowledge is called skepticism. An extreme form of skepticism denies that we can have any
              knowledge whatsoever. But we might grant that we can have knowledge about some things and
              remain skeptics concerning other issues. Many people, for instance, are not skeptics about
              scientific knowledge, but are skeptics when it comes to knowledge of morality.

              This is concerned with the nature and identiﬁcation of good inferences. Those circumstances in which

              and dominance of Christianity which permeates the philosophy done during this period. The other most
              significant link throughout the period is the interpretation andadaptation of Aristotle’s metaphysics.

              It may seem strange to call philosophy done in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries ‘modern

            <h3 class="mb-0">Truth</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              It’s natural to think that science and philosophy are mainly
              concerned with getting at the truth about things. There are two main questions about truth. It’s important
              to keep these two questions separate.
              What is it for a claim to be true?
              How do we determine that a claim is true? <br>
              Questions about how we know whether
              something is true are epistemic questions. But the question of what it is for something to be true
              is not an epistemic issue. The truth of a claim is quite independent of how or whether we know it
              to be true. <br>
              The ordinary everyday notion of truth would have it
              that a claim is true if the world is the way the claim says it is. If how
              my claim represents the world fits with the way the world is, then my claim is true.

            <h3 class="mb-0">Is Truth Relative to Meaning?</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Words and sentences can be used in lots of different ways. Even if we are not being
              inventive with language, there is lots of vagueness and ambiguity built into natural language. A
              tempting pitfall in thinking about truth is to think that truth is somehow relative to meaning or
              open to interpretation. <br>
              Our notion of truth is fundamentally about the
              correspondence between what is meant by a sentence and the way the world is. Philosophers
              often refer to what is meant or expressed by a sentence as a proposition. <br>
              The proposition does not have a meaning. Rather the proposition is what is meant. For a bit
              of language to be open to interpretation is for us to be able to attach different meanings to it. But
              the meanings themselves are not open to further interpretation. And it is the proposition, what is
              meant by the sentence, that is the fundamental bearer of truth or falsity. A proposition is true
              when it represents things the way they are.
              Getting clear on just what an argument says is critical to the
              dialectical process.

            <p class="job-description">
              An
              argument results when a group of statements, called premises, is said to lead to another
              statement, referred to as the conclusion. The relationship between premises and a conclusion can be
              described in various ways, but in general we can say that the premises
              support the truth of the conclusion, ideally (in deductive arguments) entailing or necessitating the
              conclusion, but at least (in inductive arguments) showing the conclusion most
              likely to be true.

            <p class="job-description">
              Debates that arise in philosophy often require us to decide who has the burden of proof. If a position
              violates our
              intuitions or asks us to accept a larger set of claims than we otherwise would be willing to accept, the
              person
              holding that claim has the burden of proof. For example: if I claim that, despite all appearances, all
              humans are
              selfish, I have the burden of proof: it is up to me to prove to you that people are selfish. If I can’t do
              this, then I
              have lost. If I argue that, despite appearances, Fess Parker follows me everywhere I go, I have the burden
              of
              proof. If I cannot meet it, we have to conclude that my view is false. It’s not up to you to prove me
              wrong: it’s up
              to me to prove my position true.

            <h3 class="mb-0"> Validity</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Arguments can go wrong and lead us to errors
              in two different ways. The first way is when the statements in the argument are false. The
              second way is when the relationship between the premises and conclusion is such that
              the conclusion is not entailed by the premises. When the conclusion does not follow from
              the premises, we say that the argument is invalid. When we can show that the premises do
              lead to the conclusion, we say that the argument is valid. As logicians use the term, only
              arguments can be valid or invalid. The statements in an argument are either true or false,
              but are never valid or invalid.<br>
              An argument can be valid, yet contain false propositions, as in the following example:<br><br>
              All spiders have six legs.<br>
              All six-legged creatures have wings.<br>
              Therefore, all spiders have wings. <br><br>
              Clearly, all spiders do not have wings. The argument is valid, however, because if
              the premises were true, the conclusion would follow. So, we can add to our definition
              of validity the following condition. A valid argument is one in which, if the premises are
              true, the conclusion must be true.

              majority of arguments in the natural sciences and in such social sciences as psychology, geography,

              weight to the conclusion without demonstrating conclusively the truth of these conclusions. These
              arguments are called inductive arguments, a type of reasoning that has been
              a source of great perplexity to philosophers. An inductive argument is one in which the
              premises, if true, make the conclusion probable, or likely to be true, and therefore make
              it reasonable to accept the conclusion. Inductive arguments are, however, neither valid nor invalid, since
              they do not
              prove or fail to prove their conclusion absolutely.

            <p class="job-description">
              Dualism is the thesis that mind and body are distinct substances. According to dualists, the mind is not
              the body,
              nor does it ‘arise’ naturally as a function of the body’s behavior (in the way that, say, digestion does).
              The identity theory is the thesis that the mind and the body (in particular, the brain) are just the same
              thing.

              is usually thought to imply that there are universal,

              of everything that happens. See cause and effect.

            <p class="job-description">
              In philosophy the term realism is used in a
              context of controversy in which the reality of objects of some category has been denied in some way,
              usually by claiming that the objects in question are
              creations or constructions of the human mind. The
              realist in the controversy is one who defends the
              status of the controversial objects. A philosopher
              can be a realist about one issue, while denying realism with respect to some other.

              that these statements <br> (1) are only true (or false) relative to some further factor or parameter, not
              explicitly mentioned in the statements themselves; <br>

            <p class="job-description">
              Empiricism is a cluster of different claims about knowledge, all emphasizing the role of experience.
              Materials empiricism is the thesis that all the materials for knowledge come from experience. The content
              of all
              of our thoughts is ultimately traceable back to some experience or other.
              Justification empiricism is the thesis that any justification for a claim has to appeal to experience.
              Largely opposed to empiricism is a set of claims we will call rationalism.
              Materials rationalism is the thesis that at least some of the materials for knowledge do not come from
              experience. Justification rationalism is the thesis that at least some justifications do not appeal
              exclusively to experience.

              A fallacy is a defect in an argument which misleads the mind.
              In philosophy,
              we use the term to refer to a common error in reasoning. The term is used
              most often to refer to an error in reasoning that is not immediately obvious. In other
              words, we attach the term fallacy to an argument that at first glance may seem convincing but upon closer
              scrutiny turns out not to be so.

            <h3 class="mb-0">Some Common Fallacies </h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Argumentum ad Baculum <br>
              The argumentum ad baculum fallacy is an appeal to force as the basis for accepting or
              rejecting a point of view. It is committed whenever a proposition is said to be true because those in
              positions of power say it is. In Logic, Appeal to Force is an informal fallacy of weak relevance. This
              fallacy occurs when someone implicitly or explicitly threatens the reader/listener as a justification for
              accepting their conclusion.<br> <br>
              Ad Hominem Attack <br>
              Ad hominem definition is appealing to feelings or prejudices rather than intellect.
              The ad hominem fallacy is committed when an author attempts to refute another author’s
              position by attacking the person rather than the argument. <br> <br>
              Argument from Ignorance <br>
              Argument from ignorance, also known as appeal to ignorance, is a fallacy in informal logic. The argument
              from ignorance fallacy is committed whenever it is argued that a proposition is true because
              it has not been proved false, or a certain proposition is false because
              it has not been proved true. This fallacy often occurs in situations in which there exists
              little evidence either for or against a position. <br> <br>
              Appeal to Pity <br>
              An appeal to pity is a fallacy in which someone tries to win support for an argument or idea by exploiting
              his or her opponent's feelings of pity or guilt. It is a specific kind of appeal to emotion.
              The name "Galileo argument" refers to the scientist's suffering as a result of his house arrest by the
              Inquisition.<br> <br>
              Appeal to Authority <br>
              An argument from authority, also called an appeal to authority, or argumentum ad verecundiam, is a form of
              argument in which the opinion of an authority on a topic is used as evidence to support an argument. <br>
              <br>
              Hasty Generalization <br>
              A hasty generalization is a fallacy in which a conclusion that is reached is not logically justified by
              sufficient or unbiased evidence. Hasty generalization occurs when an author cites an example that is not
              typical in order to
              make a general point covering all cases.<br>
              Ex: Often it is argued that marijuana should be legal
              because in some cases it is valuable in treating illnesses. <br> <br>
              Argumentum ad Populum <br>
              This fallacy occurs any time the sheer numbers of people who agree to something is used as a reason to get
              you to agree to it <br>
              Ex: This book has been on the New York Times' bestseller list for 64 straight weeks.<br> <br>
              Quoting Out of Context <br>
              After all, every quotation necessarily excludes large sections of the original material and is thus an
              "out of context" quotation. What makes this a fallacy is to take a selective quotation which distorts,
              alters, or even reverses the originally intended meaning. This can be done accidentally or deliberately.
              <br>
              Ex: This has been the best play I've seen all year! Of course, it is the only play I've seen all year.
              <br><br>False dilemma<br>
              Presenting a limited set of alternatives when there are others that are worth considering in the context.
              <br>
              Ex: "Every person is either my enemy or my friend. If he/she is my enemy I should hate him/her.
              <br> <br>
              Complex Question <br>
              Complex question is the familiar double or loaded question, such as “Have you stopped
              beating your wife?” Here the stated question presupposes an affirmative answer to an unasked question.
              <br> <br>
              Equivocation <br>
              This fallacy occurs whenever an argument turns on a crucial shift in the meaning
              of a significant word or phrase. A famous example is attributed by G. E. Moore to
              John Stuart Mill’s argument for ethical utilitarianism, in which Mill argues that the
              only proof possible that something is desirable is that people actually desire it. <br> <br>
              Red Herring <br>
              Red herring is the fallacy of sidetracking the argument from the issue under consideration
              to a completely different issue. Usually, this occurs when the central question at issue is
              problematic or doubtful and the red herring issue is one readily agreed to by all sides. <br> <br>
              Straw Man<br>
              The straw man is the fallacy of substituting for your opponent’s position a simplistic
              caricature. By defeating the caricature (the straw man), the fallacious impression is created that you
              have defeated your opponent’s position. <br> <br>
              Appeal to tradition <br>
              Appeal to tradition also known as argumentum ad antiquitatem or argumentum ad antiquitam is an argument in
              which a thesis is deemed correct on the basis that it is correlated
              with some past or present tradition. The appeal takes the form of "this is right because we've always done
              it this way." It's easy to find fallacious appeals to tradition in the context of religion. Indeed, it
              would probably be hard to find a religion which doesn't use the fallacy at least some of the time.
              <br><br>
              Oversimplification and Exaggeration<br>
              The causation fallacies known as oversimplification and exaggeration—also called the fallacy of reduction
              or multiplication—occur when the series of actual causes for an event is reduced or multiplied to the
              point where there is no longer a genuine, causal connection between the alleged causes and the actual
              effect. In other words, multiple causes are reduced to just one or a few (oversimplification) or a couple
              of causes are multiplied into many (exaggeration). <br>
              Ex: The nation's current lack of moral standards was caused by the poor example set by Bill Clinton when
              he was president. <br><br>
              Begging the Question <br>
              Begging the question also known as a "Circular
              Argument" - because the conclusion essentially appears both at the beginning and the end of the argument,
              it creates an endless circle, never accomplishing anything of substance. <br>
              Ex: The Bible is true because God exists, and God exists because the Bible says so.
