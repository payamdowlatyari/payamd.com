              Let’s define psychology as the systematic study of behavior and experience.<br>
              The word experience lets us discuss your perceptions without implying that a mind exists independently of
              your body. The philosophical question of how experience relates to the brain is the mind-brain problem

            <p class="job-description">
              Dualism holds that the mind is separate from the brain but somehow controls the brain and therefore the
              rest of the body. However, dualism contradicts the law of conservation of matter and energy, one of the
              cornerstones of physics. According to that principle, the only way to influence any matter or energy,
              including the matter and energy that compose your body, is to act on it with other matter or energy.

              Researchers and philosophers favor monism, the view that conscious experience is inseparable from the
              physical brain. That is, mental activity is brain activity. So far as we can tell, consciousness cannot
              exist without brain activity. <br>
              Evidence supports monism: Every type of mental activity is associated with some type of measurable brain
              activity. Also, any type of brain damage leads to a deficit in some aspect of behavior or experience.

            long-term memory via processes like rehearsal. <br>
            One way we are able to expand our ability to remember things in STM is by using a memory technique called

            Implicit memory refers to the influence of experience on behaviour, even if the individual is not aware of
            those influences. <br>
            There are three general types of implicit memory: procedural memory, classical conditioning effects, and
            priming. <br>
            Procedural memory refers to our often unexplainable knowledge of how to do things. <br>
            A second type of implicit memory is classical conditioning effects, in which we learn, often without effort
            or awareness, to associate neutral stimuli (such as a sound or a light) with another stimulus (such as
            food), which creates a naturally occurring response, such as enjoyment or salivation. <br>
            The final type of implicit memory is known as priming, or changes in behaviour as a result of experiences
            that have happened frequently or recently.

            Different types of motivation are frequently described as being either extrinsic or intrinsic: <br>

            Extrinsic motivations are those that arise from outside of the individual and often involve rewards such as

            Intrinsic motivations are those that arise from within the individual, such as doing a complicated crossword
            puzzle purely for the personal gratification of solving a problem.

            To measure emotion, researchers measure sympathetic nervous system arousal as indicated by heart rate,
            breathing rate, or momentary changes in the electrical conductivity across the skin. Physiological
            measurements do not tell us which emotion someone is feeling.

            Psychodynamic theory, also known as psychoanalytic psychotherapy, helps clients understand their emotions

            The greatest criticism of the psychodynamic approach is that it is unscientific in its analysis of human

            The preconscious consists of anything that could potentially be brought into the conscious mind.<br>
            The conscious mind contains all of the thoughts, memories, feelings, and wishes of which we are aware at any
            given moment. This is the aspect of our mental processing that we can think and talk about rationally. This
            also includes our memory, which is not always part of consciousness but can be retrieved easily and brought
            into awareness.<br>
            The unconscious mind is a reservoir of feelings, thoughts, urges, and memories that are outside of our
            conscious awareness. The unconscious contains contents that are unacceptable or unpleasant, such as feelings
            of pain, anxiety, or conflict.

            body parts. Children go through five stages of psychosexual development, and each leaves its mark on the
            adult personality. If normal sexual development is blocked or frustrated at any stage, Freud said, part of
            the libido is held in fixation at that stage, and the person continues to be preoccupied with the pleasure

            Repression is a type of psychological defense mechanism that involves keeping certain thoughts, feelings, or
            urges out of conscious awareness. The goal of this form of defense is to keep unacceptable desires or
            thoughts out of the conscious mind in order to prevent or minimize feelings of anxiety.

            Piaget called the first stage of intellectual development the sensorimotor stage because at this early age
            (the first to 2 years) behavior is mostly simple motor responses to sensory stimuli—for example, the grasp
            reflex and the sucking reflex. <br>
            Piaget argued that infants in the first few months of life lack the concept of object permanence, the idea
            that objects continue to exist even when we do not see or hear them.

            According to Piaget, three typical aspects of preoperational thought are egocentrism, difficulty
            distinguishing appearance from reality, and lack of the concept of conservation.

            arrangement of the objects. They cannot perform the mental operations necessary to understand the

            researchers found that many people reach this stage later or not at all. <br>

            Social loafing describes the tendency of individuals to put forth less effort when they are part of a group.
            Because all members of the group are pooling their effort to achieve a common goal, each member of the group
            contributes less than they would if they were individually responsible.

            Transactional Analysis is a theory developed by Dr. Eric Berne in the 1950s.
            Transactional Analysis is a social psychology and a method to improve communication. The
            theory outlines how we have developed and treat ourselves, how we relate and communicate with others, and
            offers
            suggestions and interventions which will enable us to change and grow.

            Berne believed that when we interact with other people, our state of

            He believed that there were three states of mind in all humans, no
            matter how old they were, called ego states.
            They categorise the ways
            we think, feel and behave and are called Parent, Adult, and Child.
            If we are to change our Parent or Child we must do so through our adult.
            In other words: <br>
            - Parent is our 'Taught' concept of life <br>
            - Child is our 'Felt' concept of life <br>
            - Adult is our 'Thought' concept of life

            The Adult ego state is about being spontaneous and aware with the capacity for intimacy.
            When in our Adult we are able
            to see people as they are, rather than what we project onto them. We ask for information rather than stay

          <h3 class="mb-0">The ‘OK’ Position</h3>
          <p class="job-description">

            Berne had a positive view of human nature, as expressed in the TA statement: ‘I
            am OK; you are OK’.
            When we are conceived we are hopefully at peace, waiting to emerge into the world once we have grown
            sufficiently to
            be able to survive in the outside of the womb. If nothing untoward happens we will emerge contented and
            relaxed. In this
            case we are likely to perceive the world from the perspective of 'I am OK and You are OK'.
            However, perhaps our mother had some traumatic experiences, or the birth was difficult or even life
            threatening. This
            experience is likely to have an effect on the way we experience the world, even at the somatic level. In
            which case we
            might emerge sensing that life is scary and might, for example, go into 'I am not OK and You are not OK
            either.
            If we were treated punitively, talked down to, and not held,
            we may begin to believe 'I am not OK and You are OK'.
            If we were bullied as a child, we learnt that the way to get by was to
            bully others and that way we felt stronger and in control. Our behaviour then comes into the 'I am OK and
            You
            are not OK'
            quadrant.
            These 'OK' or life positions are perceptions of the world. The reality is I just am and you just are,
            therefore how
            I view myself and
            others are just that "views" not fact.

          <h3 class="mb-0">Strokes</h3>
          <p class="job-description">
            Eric Berne defined a stroke as a “unit of
            human recognition”. A stroke can be a look, a
            nod, a smile, a spoken word, a touch. Any time
            one human being does something to recognize
            another human being, that is a stroke. Babies
            need strokes to survive.
            Strokes can be positive or negative. Most of
            us like positive strokes better than negative
            ones. When children are not
            able to get positive strokes, they will make their
            best effort to get the negative ones, since
            negative strokes are better than no strokes at
            all.

            The fundamental unit of social interaction is the ‘stroke’, or unit of recogntion.
            Exchanging strokes is a transaction, and in a transaction one of the three ego
            states is predominantly cathected or energised. In other words, transactions take
            place between ego states, and so at the basic level TA involves analysing ego states
            that are engaged in stimulus and response exchanges. There are three types of
            transaction: complementary, crossed and ulterior.

            other. This he called the Transaction Stimulus. The reaction from the other person he called the

            The person sending the Stimulus is called the Agent. The person who responds is called the

            Complementary transactions are those in which individuals receive a response

            • Parent–parent: talking about the state of society. <br>

            one addressed, and/or may go to an ego state that is not the one that sent the
            original stimulus. Communication is broken off when a crossed transaction
            occurs. this may only be slight and momentary but it can be a complete break.

            With ulterior transactions a covert, risky communication is disguised as
            an overt and more socially acceptable one. A lot of human interaction has more
            than an overt social meaning; it has a deeper psychological agenda too. By
            definition a psychological game is an ulterior transaction. For example someone
            might say ‘Thanks for the lift home, would you like to pop in for a drink?’ and the
            other person says ‘Yes please, I could do with one’. The first person is offering an
            opportunity for seduction and the second one has accepted.

            Scripting is the process by which individuals, normally in childhood, make farreaching decisions that

            a preconscious life plan by which individuals structure their time. Such scripts
            determine their approach to relationships and tasks, and are based on infantile
            illusions that can persist for a lifetime. <br>
            Five factors play a role in people’s script decisions: <br>

            behaviour. It means being free of one’s parents and their influence, so that they
            can be visited from time to time but can no longer exert their influence. Gaining
            autonomy requires the overthrow of three things: <br>

            When similar situations keep happening over and over again then the term Transactional Analysis

            of course we don't.
            Games are learned patterns of behavior, and most people play a small number of favorite games
            with a range of different people and in varying intensities.
            Games vary in the length of time that passes while they are being played. Some can take seconds or
            minutes while others take weeks months or even years.
            People play games for these reasons: <br>
            - to structure time <br>
            - to acquire strokes <br>
            - to maintain the substitute feeling and the system of thinking, beliefs and actions that go with it <br>

            or get others who are stronger, more powerful, healthier or simply luckier to solve
            things for him).
            This is the favourite game of the indolent, those who do not have much pride or
            willpower and, in extreme cases, do not care much about being insulted if, in
            return, they get the benefits of having their work done for them or resources given
            to them. Some employees who see themselves as inferior often play the “wooden
            leg” game in an attempt to earn pity because of their misfortune or lack of
            resources, their bad luck, personal circumstances, etc., and in many cases they get
            other colleagues and even their bosses to help them or do their work for them.

          <p class="job-description">
            This is one of the most destructive games there is, as it tends to be “violent” and it
            is one that Freud himself, the founder of psychoanalysis, classed as a form of
            sadism or sexual pleasure with TA nuances, as a product of the RAC (Rebellious
            Adapted Child). To this we would add that there is a combination of “Critical
            Parent” (Millon’s Compensatory Narcissist) in which they resort to the “little
            professor” to deceive players, making them play without them realising that they
            are entering the ring, so that the organiser then enjoys throwing a stone at them
            from the barrier and seeing how the cocks fight each other to the death. They are
            thereby reaffirming their need to water down others’ expectations by proving that
            “everyone is stupid” or, in other words, “everyone is not OK” and “so you cannot
            be better than me even if I’m not OK, because you’re no better, and maybe you’re
            even worse”.

          <p class="job-description">
            The blame game was described as “If it weren’t for you”. Examples of the blame game may include:
            A wife that says to her husband, “If it weren’t for you, I would be an actress”;
            A father that says to his daughter, “If it weren’t for you, I would have my university degree”;
            A man that says to his wife, “If it weren’t for you, my life would be so much more exciting”.
            The objective of this game is usually vindication; by blaming somebody else we get an illusion that our own
            underperformance is justified. The game is malicious because it instills the feeling of guilt to the other
            person while helping us escape responsibility.

          <h3 class="mb-0">Corner or Double Bind </h3>
          <p class="job-description">
            The double bind game is when the main player puts another person in a disadvantageous situation they can’t
            escape from, no matter what they choose. For example, a supervisor may intentionally delegate a difficult
            task to a person who doesn’t qualify for this level of work. Or a woman may ask her husband to help with
            something even when both know beforehand that she will blame him later on. In the first case the goal could
            be getting the person fired or “showing them their place”. In the second case, the wife might want to make
            her husband feel guilty or inadequate, or perhaps to initiate a bigger conflict and, eventually, get a
            divorce.

            Psychopathology is a term which refers to either the study of mental illness or mental distress or the

            Psychopathology is not the same as psychopathy, which has to do with antisocial personality disorders and

            Personality disorder is a persistent
            pattern of thinking, feeling, and

            disorders begin at a relatively early
            age, are stable over time, and are
            pervasive and inflexible.
