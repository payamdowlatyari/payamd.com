              I am passionate about problem-solving, critical thinking, and logical reasoning.
              Computer Science is about problem-solving and involves studying and understanding computational
              processes and the development of algorithms and techniques to solve problems. <br>
              As a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms,
              computation and information to the practical issues of implementing computational systems in hardware and
              software. <br><br>
              In this blog, I try to introduce and explain some important concepts of Computer Science, Software
              Engineering, Computer Networks, Web
              Development, User Experience Design, and so on based on my study and research from credible sources.

              There are many reasons to study psychology, from career prospects to personal interest. Psychology is a
              fascinating area of study.
              It is one of my favorite areas of study that allows me to better understand
              people's intetions, motivations, and needs.
              <br>
              Psychology is the scientific study of the mind and behavior, according to the American Psychological
              Association. Psychology is a multifaceted discipline and includes many sub-fields of study such areas as
              human development, sports, health, clinical, social behavior and cognitive processes. <br><br>
              Here, I would like to discuss some essential and key concepts of Psychology including Personality,
              Learning, Mental
              Development,
              Intelligence, Social Psychology, Biological Psychology, etc. All definitions and theories are extracted
              from reliable scientific
              sources.

              Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light, either
              electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as
              photographic film.
              There are a number of photography genres including portrait,
              landscape,
              architecture, fashion, food, sports, wildlife, macro, street, event and documentary photography.
              I'd like to share some fundamentals concepts of
              photography in this blog.

            <p class="job-description">
              I think philosophy is an activity of mind. Philosophy is what happens when you start thinking for
              yourself. It is a way of thinking about certain sorts
              of question. I like philosophy because it gives me power to have a better understanding of reality and
              helps me to learn how to ask the right questions and how to criticize wrong beliefs.
              <br><br>
              Once one frees oneself from the habits of received belief, those that one
              just happens to have acquired even about basic issues, and really starts to think about what one ought to
              believe, judged by reason (argument) and evidence, then one has started to do philosophy.
              Let's take a look at some important terms and concepts in philosophy from scientific sources.

              Sociology is the study of human behavior. Sociology refers to social behavior, society, patterns of social
              relationships, social interaction, and culture that surrounds everyday life.
              It helps us look more objectively at our society and other societies. It directs attention to how the
              parts
              of society fit together and change, as well as makes us aware of the consequences of that social change
              <br><br>
              As I am very interested in different aspects of societies in relation with people and collective behavior,
              groups, statuses and roles, I
              gathered some
              of its basic concepts and definitions from reliable resources.

              Economics is the science that concerns itself with economies. An economy is the large set of inter-related
              production, consumption, and exchange activities that aid in determining how scarce resources are
              allocated.
              Economics is a social science concerned with the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and
              services. It studies how individuals, businesses, governments, and nations make choices about how to
              allocate resources.
              <br><br>
              I believe everyone should be familiar with the basics of economics in the modern societies. I like
              studying
              economics because this knowledge gives you the power to understand how humans or societies deal with each
              other
              over having access and using the scare resources.
