            <p class="job-description">
              Sociology is the study of groups and group interactions, societies and social interactions, from small and
              personal groups
              to very large groups. <br>
              The term
              sociology is a combination of two words. The first part of
              the term is a Latin, socius- that may variously mean
              society, association, togetherness or companionship.<br>
              The other word, logos, is of Greek origin. It literally
              means to speak about or word. <br>
              The concepts
              “society and “culture” are central in sociology.

            <p class="job-description">
              Since ancient times, people have been fascinated by the relationship between individuals and the societies
              to which they
              belong. Many topics studied in modern sociology were also studied by ancient philosophers in their desire
              to describe an
              ideal society, including theories of social conflict, economics, social cohesion, and power. <br>
              The first social scientist to use the term sociology was
              a Frenchman by the name of Auguste Comte who lived
              from 1798-1857. <br>
              Although the term “sociology” was first used by the
              French social philosopher august Comte, the discipline
              was more firmly established by such theorists as Emile
              Durkheim, Karl Marx and Max Weber.

              Generally, learning sociology provides us with what
              sociologists call the sociological imagination.
              Sociological imagination is a particular way of looking at
              the world around us through sociological lenses. It is a
              way of looking at our experiences in light of what is
              going on in the social world around us. This helps us to
              appreciate the social and non-biological forces that
              affect, influence and shape our lives as individuals,
              groups, and communities

              and Disciplines </h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Sociology occupies an important position among the
              disciplines, usually called the social sciences. These
              include sociology, anthropology, psychology,
              economics, political science, history and human
              geography. These disciplines are sometimes also
              referred to as behavioral sciences, as they study the
              principles governing human social behavior.

            <p class="job-description">
              As a general difference, we might say that while both disciplines are interested in human behavior,
              psychologists are
              focused on how the mind influences that behavior, while sociologists study the role of society in shaping
              behavior.
              Psychologists are interested in people’s mental development and how their minds process their world.
              Sociologists
              are more likely to focus on how different aspects of society contribute to an individual’s relationship
              with his world.

            <p class="job-description">
              Sociologists study social events, interactions, and patterns, and they develop a theory in an attempt to
              explain why things
              work as they do. In sociology, a theory is a way to explain different aspects of social interactions and
              to create a testable
              proposition, called a hypothesis, about society.
              <br>
              Theories vary in scope depending on the scale of the issues that they are meant to explain. Macro-level
              theories relate to
              large-scale issues and large groups of people, while micro-level theories look at very specific
              relationships between
              individuals or small groups

              In sociology, a few theories provide broad perspectives that help explain many different aspects of social
              life, and these are
              called paradigms. Paradigms are philosophical and theoretical frameworks used within a discipline to
              formulate theories,
              generalizations, and the experiments performed in support of them.

              parts designed to meet
              the biological and social needs of the individuals in that society. Functionalism grew out of the writings
              of English
              philosopher and biologist, Hebert Spencer, who saw similarities between society and the human
              body; he
              argued that just as the various organs of the body work together to keep the body functioning, the various
              parts of society
              work together to keep society functioning.

              approach most
              identified with the writings of German philosopher and sociologist Karl Marx (1818–1883), who saw society
              as being
              made up of individuals in different social classes who must compete for social, material, and political
              resources such as
              food and housing, employment, education, and leisure time.

              Symbolic interactionism is a micro-level theory that focuses on the relationships among individuals within
              a society.
              Communication—the exchange of meaning through language and symbols—is believed to be the way in which
              people

              make sense of their social worlds. Theorists Herman and Reynolds note that this perspective sees
              people as being
              active in shaping the social world rather than simply being acted upon.

              Constructivism is an extension of symbolic interaction theory which proposes that reality is what humans
              cognitively
              construct it to be. We develop social constructs based on interactions with others, and those constructs
              that last over time
              are those that have meanings which are widely agreed-upon or generally accepted by most within the
              society.

              One way researchers test social theories is by conducting an experiment, meaning they investigate
              relationships to test a hypothesis—a scientific approach.
              There are two main types of experiments: lab-based experiments and natural or field experiments.
              In a lab setting, the research can be controlled so that perhaps more data can be recorded in a certain
              amount of time. In a natural or field-based experiment, the generation of data cannot be controlled but
              the information might be considered more accurate since it was collected without interference or
              intervention by the researcher.

              Sociologists make use of tried and true methods of research, such as experiments, surveys, and field
              research. But humans and their social interactions are so diverse that they can seem impossible to chart
              or explain. It might seem that science is about discoveries and chemical reactions or about proving
              ideas right or wrong rather than about exploring the nuances of human behavior.

              A hypothesis is an assumption about how two or more variables are related; it makes a conjectural
              statement about the relationship between those variables. In sociology, the hypothesis will often predict
              how one form of human behavior influences another. In research, independent variables are the cause
              of the change. The dependent variable is the effect, or thing that is changed

              While many sociologists rely on the scientific method as a research approach, others operate from an
              interpretive framework. While systematic, this approach doesn’t follow the hypothesis-testing model
              that seeks to find generalizable results. Instead, an interpretive framework, sometimes referred to as an
              interpretive perspective, seeks to understand social worlds from the point of view of participants,
              leading to in-depth knowledge.

              scientific research methods. The standard survey format allows individuals a level of anonymity in

              collected from primary sources, but are the already completed work of other researchers. Sociologists
              might study works written by historians, economists, teachers, or early sociologists. They might search

              Humans are social creatures. Since the dawn of Homo sapiens nearly 250,000 years ago, people have grouped
              together
              into communities in order to survive. Living together, people form common habits and behaviors—from
              specific methods
              of childrearing to preferred techniques for obtaining food.

            <p class="job-description">
              People often misuse the concept of
              culture. Some misconceptions about the to term culture
              include: <br>
              1. Many people in the western world use the term
              culture in the sense that some people are more
              "cultured" than others. When one is said to
              be “cultured”, he or she is said to be civilized. <br>
              2. A second commonly used misconception is that
              which equates “culture" with things which are
              colorful, customs, cloths, foods, dancing, music,
              etc. <br>
              3. A third misconception about what culture is and
              what it constitutes is that which may be
              entertained by many common people here in
              Ethiopia. This misconception is similar to the
              second one, but it differs from it in that most
              people here think culture
              is that which pertains to unique traditional
              material objects or non – material things of the
              past.

            <p class="job-description">
              People with the best intentions sometimes travel to a society to “help” its
              people, because
              they see them as uneducated or backward—essentially inferior. In reality, these travelers are guilty of
              cultural
              imperialism, the deliberate imposition of one’s own cultural values on another culture. Europe’s colonial
              expansion,
              begun in the sixteenth century, was often accompanied by a severe cultural imperialism. European
              colonizers often viewed
              the people in the lands they colonized as uncultured savages who were in need of European governance,
              dress, religion,
              and other cultural practices. <br>
              The global culture may
              entail all speaking the some language, share the same
              values and norms, and sustain common und of
              knowledge as of residents of the same community
              . Global culture may also be associated
              with cultural imperialism, the unequal cultural
              exchange in the global system whereby western
              material and non-material cultures have come to occupy
              a dominating and imposing roles over the indigenous
              cultures of the Third World peoples.
              The global culture is often promoted by: <br>
              - The global spread of capitalism <br>
              - Consumerism and the consumer culture <br>
              - The growth of transnational media, particularly

              Lead </h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Culture is dynamic. When culture change occurs, the
              change is usually not evenly distributed across material
              and non-material dimensions of culture. The rate of
              change is not balanced. Material culture may change at
              a faster rate than non- material culture. The growth in
              science and technology in western, industrialized
              societies for example, does not seem to be matched by
              the necessary changes and appropriate adjustment of
              adaptive culture. That is non-material culture changes
              slowly. This condition is termed as culture lag.

              <br>
              On the other hand, in some less developed societies,
              the change of non-material culture may outpace the
              material culture. When this occurs, it is called culture
              lead. Due to the effect of globalization and rapid
              assimilation processes, people in the Third World are
              accustomed to the ideology and cultures of the Western
              World, though their material culture is not changing
              keeping pace with non- material culture.

              High culture consists of things that are generally associated with the social elite.
              The opera, cotillions or debutante balls, classical music and literature, wine tastings, and the fine arts

            <p class="job-description">
              A subculture is just as it sounds—a smaller cultural group within a larger culture; people of a
              subculture are part of the larger culture, but also share a specific identity within a smaller group.
              Thousands of subcultures exist within the United States. Ethnic and racial groups share the
              language, food, and customs of their heritage. <br>
              Sociologists distinguish subcultures from countercultures, which are a type of subculture that
              rejects some of the larger culture’s norms and values. In contrast to subcultures, which operate
              relatively smoothly within the larger society, countercultures might actively defy larger society by
              developing their own set of rules and norms to live by, sometimes even creating communities that

              Socialization is critical both to individuals and to the societies in which they live. It illustrates how
              completely intertwined
              human beings and their social worlds are.
              Socialization is just as essential to us as individuals. Social interaction provides the means via which
              we gradually become
              able to see ourselves through the eyes of others, and how we learn who we are and how we fit into the
              world around us. In
              addition, to function successfully in society, we have to learn the basics of both material and
              nonmaterial culture,
              everything from how to dress ourselves to what’s suitable attire for a specific occasion.

              Social groups often provide the first experiences of socialization. Families, and later peer groups,
              communicate

              school, or serves
              time in jail. In the new environment, the old rules no longer apply. The process of resocialization is
              typically more
              stressful than normal socialization because people have to unlearn behaviors that have become customary to
              them.

            <p class="job-description">
              The term group is an amorphous one and can refer to a wide variety of gatherings, from just two people, a
              club, a regular gathering of friends,
              or people who
              work together or share a hobby. In short, the term refers to any collection of at least two people who
              interact with some
              frequency and who share a sense that their identity is somehow aligned with the group.

            <p class="job-description">
              A primary group is a group in which one exchanges implicit items, such as love, caring, concern, support,
              etc. Examples of these would be family groups and love relationships, crisis. Relationships formed in
              primary
              groups are often long lasting and goals in themselves. <br>
              Unlike first groups, secondary groups are large groups whose relationships are impersonal and goal
              oriented. People in a secondary group interact on a less personal level than in a primary group, and their
              relationships are generally temporary rather than long lasting.

            <p class="job-description">
              Sociologist William Sumner developed the concepts of in-group and
              out-group to explain this phenomenon. In short, an in-group is the group that an individual
              feels she
              belongs to, and she believes it to be an integral part of who she is. An out-group, conversely, is a group
              someone doesn’t
              belong to; often we may feel disdain or competition in relationship to an out-group.

              People who exist in the same place at the same time but who do not interact or share
              a sense of identity—such as a bunch of people standing in line at Starbucks—are considered an aggregate,

              These people are considered a category, and as an example all children born from approximately 1980–2000
              are referred
              to as “Millennials.” Why are Millennials a category and not a group? Because while some of them may share
              a sense of
              identity, they do not, as a whole, interact frequently with each other.

              what they do with their free time—and they compare themselves to what they see.
              Some other examples of reference groups can be one’s cultural center, workplace, family gathering, and

              A social movement is a persistent and organized effort involving the
              mobilization of large numbers of people to work together to either bring
about what they believe to be beneficial social change or resist or reverse
what they believe to be harmful social change. Social movements are
among the most dramatic events the world has ever known. The United
States has experienced great movements such as the abolitionist movement to end slavery in the nineteenth century, the women's suffrage
movement to win the vote for women in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s
to end racial discrimination. Along with certain national election campaigns, social movements have become the most important collective
force for bringing about change in the country's history.

            <h3 class="mb-0">Types of Social Movements</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Social movements can be classified in a number of ways. One can
              first consider whether the movement intends to bring about or resist
              change.  <br> <br> 
              An innovative (liberal) movement intends to introduce
              something new with regard to culture, patterns of behavior, policies,
              or institutions. For example, a liberal movement exists to legalize marijuana.  <br>
              A conservative movement has the goal of maintaining things
              the way they are (resisting change), such as the movement to prevent
              legalization of marijuana where it remains illegal.  <br>
              A reactionary movement seeks to resurrect cultural elements, patterns of behavior, or institutions of the past (“bring back the good old days”). An example would
              be a movement that wants to return to banning same-sex marriage.<br> <br> 
              Movements can also be classified in terms of which aspects of society are targeted for change. Is change sought in patterns of behavior,
              culture, policies, or institutions? Are the changes meant to affect everyone, or only a particular group of people? 
              It is important to note that some movements are more than one type. For example, the feminist movement
has aspects that permit it to be classified as an innovative (liberal)
movement, a reform movement, an identity movement, a new social
movement, and a transnational movement.

          <div class="resume-content">
            <h3 class="mb-0">Reform</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              A reform movement calls
              for change in patterns of behavior, culture, and/or policy, but does not
              try to replace entire social institutions. Supporters of reform movements
              appeal to policymakers, attempt to elect candidates, and sometimes
              bring cases before courts to achieve their goals. Movements involving
              civil rights, women's rights, sexual orientation, and the rights of people
              with disabilities all call for acceptance by the larger culture to ensure
              equal access to all social institutions but do not aim to replace them.
              Antiwar and environmental movements are also considered reform
              movements because they call for changes in government policy rather
              than sweeping institutional change.

            <p class="job-description">
              A revolutionary movement in contrast, aims to bring about great
structural change by replacing one or more major social institutions. 
<br> <br>
In
the eighteenth century, the American Revolution succeeded in changing
the political system of the original thirteen colonies by freeing colonists
from British monarchical control and creating a democratic form of
government. 
<br> 
In the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century,
the French Revolution ended a monarchy and established a republic.  <br> 
More contemporary examples of successful revolutions include the 1979
Iranian Revolution that replaced a monarchy with a fundamentalist
Islamic republic, the revolutions that swept away one-party political systems in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union from 1989 to
1991, and the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa that ended the
system of white political domination there in 1994.

            <h3 class="mb-0">Identity Movements</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
             The major goal of an identity movement is to spread understanding of mechanisms of domination, including cultural elements such as oppressive
language, to destroy debilitating stereotypes, ways of thinking, and talking
that are the means and products of group subordination. These movements attempt to create a new identity
for the oppressed group that provides a sense of empowerment, pride,
self-confidence and equality and also actively confront the larger public's norms, beliefs, behaviors, and ways of thinking 
Identity movements develop among persons who perceive
themselves to be the target of discrimination based on an ascribed characteristic such as race, nationality, physical characteristics, gender, sexual
orientation, or other fixed traits. <br>  <br>

For example, the feminist movement
attacks the traditional view of women as lacking the intelligence, will,
emotional stability, or toughness to successfully participate in all areas of
life by focusing attention on women who have made great achievements
in politics, science, and business. This movement also promotes traits
traditionally associated with women, such as compassion and cooperativeness, as crucial to the well-being of society. 
The purpose of the feminist movement is to provide all women with psychological empowerment and
positive identities, and to replace stereotypes that limit their roles or define
them as inferior with a global conception of women as equal to men.

            <p class="job-description">
              Some sociologists believe that, in the first half of the twentieth century, social movements in the most technologically advanced societies
centered on economic goals. These dealt mainly with the redistribution of wealth and income and were based primarily on the industrial
and urban work forces. In the second half, there was a perceived shift
to identity movements and movements focusing on government policies. These new social movements were concerned with moral and
quality-of-life issues and the establishment of new collective identities. Examples of new social movements include peace movements (like
the anti-Vietnam War Movement of the 1960s and early 1970s) and movements focusing on the environment, women's rights, gay rights,
and animal rights.

              Certain movements, sometimes called alternative movements,
aim to change a single type of behavior. For example, the temperance
movement of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, similar in
focus to today's antidrug movement, tried to convince people not to
drink alcohol because of suspected links to child and spousal abuse,
other violent crimes, and social ills. Another example is an abstinence
movement. Abstinence movements such as True Love Waits advocate
sexual relations only after marriage.

              Student activism ranges from protests against university administrations
to mobilizations that have contributed to the downfall of governments.
Many students, brimming with idealism, have initiated social movements or joined existing ones. 
The Social Movements box describes an important social movement action that began with a sit-in at a lunch
counter by four college students in 1960. In the years that followed, hundreds of thousands of students became 
active in the civil rights movement, as well as the antiwar, women's, environmental, and gay rights
movements. Today, students are involved in movements fighting for
social justice and human rights and participating in activist groups, such
as the new Students for a Democratic Society, successor to the massive
Vietnam War-era student organization of the same name.

            <p class="job-description">
              Because social movements have played such important roles in shaping human history, social scientists have studied them and come up
with a number of explanations for why they develop. One approach
is to explain why people are or become discontented with a particular
condition or pattern of behavior. It is easy to understand why some
events provoke widespread anger. For example, if for some reason all
of the public school teachers in California were suddenly subjected to
a 25 percent cut in pay, you would expect that most California teachers would be outraged and engage in some form of public protest.

              Theories</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              According to absolute deprivation theory, social movements develop
when people are unable to obtain adequate food, shelter, or other basic
needs. However, history shows that people living in poverty over a
period of generations develop the cultural outlook that their situation is
fated and unchangeable. Similarly, the existence of wide gaps in wealth
levels of groups in a society does not seem sufficient to bring about
social movements. Social movements, including revolutionary movements, 
appear to develop not just as a result of deprivation or inequality
but because of expectations and moral beliefs concerning fairness and
social justice. <br>
When living conditions or political limitations only become intolerable when people
come to view them as unacceptable relative to how they think things
should be. There are three ways this view, called
relative deprivation theory, can develop: <br><br>
1. Decremental deprivation involves a rapid
drop in living standards caused by an event such as a sudden severe
economic downturn. People feel deprived relative to their former
living standards. <br>
2. Progressive deprivation occurs when a society experiences a prolonged period
of economic progress and improved living standards followed by a
period of sharp decline. Since people expect things to keep getting
better as they had in previous years, a wide gap develops between
expectations and worsening conditions.  <br>
3. Aspirational deprivation occurs when
people gain new information convincing them that their living
conditions are unacceptable and can be changed, causing discontent to rise and support for social movements to increase.

            <p class="job-description">
              According this theory, people motivated to create a social movement must have access to necessary resources to succeed. 
              Useful resources include funding, effective leaders,
and access to social networks through which new participants can be
recruited. Other beneficial resources can be the support of powerful
persons, aid from previously established social movement organizations,
and assistance from important moral figures who can bestow legitimacy
on the movement and its goals. For example, the civil rights movement 
benefitted from the support of many African American churches and their leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr

            <p class="job-description">
              According to this theory (also
called political process theory), political context is key to
explaining social movements and their effects on society. 
Social movements arise at times when political circumstances for their success are
favorable. In other words, people only initiate a social movement when
they perceive that the political climate will allow them to organize successfully and achieve their goals. 
In addition, a social movement that is already underway will often attempt to use its influence to make the
political environment more favorable.

            <h3 class="mb-0">Leadership Theory</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Leadership theory asserts that the emergence and success of social
movements requires exceptional leaders. Leaders can be classified
into three types. Charismatic leaders, usually the
type most widely recognized by the public, emotionally inspire others
through their words and their actions and by presenting the movement as an essential moral struggle. 
Famous charismatic leaders include
Mahatma Gandhi of India's revolutionary movement for independence
and democracy, Martin Luther King Jr. of the American civil rights 
movement, and Nelson Mandela of South Africa's anti-apartheid struggle. <br><br>
Types of Leaders: <br>
1. intellectual leader is
type of leader who provides a social movement
with ideology explaining
the problem, its cause, and
the need for action.<br>
2. Managerial leader is
type of leader who transforms the ideals and goals
of the movement into
organization and coordinated action.
<br><br>
Leaders must decide on strategy and tactics. In the context of social
movements, strategy is a general
approach for achieving
movement goals and
tactics The immediate
actions used to implement
a strategy.

            <h3 class="mb-0">Framing Theory</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Framing theory describes the processes through which an individual
comes to embrace the ideology of, and supports and participates in,
a social movement. Advocates of framing theory believe
that other theories are all incomplete explanations of social movements.
They argue that one of the important tasks of a social movement's leaders 
is to present or “frame” a social movement in terms of the core values held by people the movement seeks to recruit. 
Whatever social structural conditions are present, a social movement is unlikely to develop
unless leaders accomplish this. Framing is the process of describing
the movement in such a way that it makes sense, appeals to as many
people as possible, and fulfills one or more deeply held values. <br><br>
Framing accomplishes three tasks:<br>
1. Diagnosis. Diagnostic framing explains why a condition or pattern
of behavior is a problem and what or who causes it.<br>
2. Prognosis. Prognostic framing proposes a solution and a plan
of action, including strategy and tactics, for social movement
participants.<br>
3. Motivation. Motivational framing explains why people need to act
to deal with the problem.

            <h3 class="mb-0">Multi-Factor Theory</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
This theory was developed to explain not just social movements but a wide range of collective behavior including riots, vigilantism, collective panics, and crazes or fads.
Here are Smelser's six
factors that explain the development of a social movement:<br><br>
1. Structural conduciveness. It is the underlying characteristics of a
society that make the development of a social movement possible and influence what type of movement emerges. For example,
if a government blocks all means of communication, it may be
difficult for a movement to emerge. As you may know,
the development of the Internet and social media, along with
the increased use of cell phones, played a major role in the Arab
Awakening protests in the winter and spring of 2011 that toppled
governments in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya.<br>
2. Structural strain. Factors such as absolute or relative deprivation
in terms of expectations, aspirations, or moral ideals cause largescale discontent. 
In Tunisia and other Arab nations that experienced massive explosions of protest in late 2010 and 2011, people
became intensely frustrated by repressive dictatorships, brutal and
corrupt security forces, and limited economic opportunities.<br>
3. Growth and spread of a generalized belief (ideology). This is the
development of a shared common explanation for the cause of the
condition generating discontent and a belief that something can
and should be done about it. In the Arab uprisings, most people
believed the dictatorships to be the central cause of problems and
that large-scale protests were necessary to remove them.<br>
4. Precipitating factors. These are dramatic events that confirm
or justify the generalized belief and provoke people to action.
The self-immolation of a poverty-stricken, twenty-six-year-old Tunisian 
street vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi, on December 17, 2010,
sparked the Tunisian rebellion. He had been harassed repeatedly
and then beaten by police after trying to sell produce to support
his mother and siblings. This tragic and desperate act against a
corrupt dictatorship ignited massive protests against the government, which then spread to other Arab nations.<br>
5. Mobilization. Leaders encourage and organize movement supporters in mass protests 
and related activities such as boycotts, petitions, campaigns for (or against) certain political candidates, court
battles, and other measures to achieve movement goals.<br>
6. Operation of social control. Depending on the movement, those
with power in society may support it, attempt to manipulate it by
influencing one of the first five factors, oppose it, or even attempt
to violently repress it. In Tunisia and Egypt, government repression was overwhelmed by popular protest.

            <h3 class="mb-0">Stages of Social Movements</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Social movements tend to go through a number of stages of development.<br><br>
              1. Incipiency is the first stage
              of a social movement,
              which begins when a large
              number of people become
              distressed by a particular
              situation.<br>
              2. Coalescence is the second
stage of a social movement, in which it becomes
more organized and develops resource-gathering
capabilities.<br>
3. Institutionalization is the
third stage of a social
movement, in which the
government takes official
notice of the movement
and tries to cope with
it and the movement
establishes one or more
geographically extensive
or even national social
movement organizations.<br>
4. Tragmentation is the
fourth stage of a social
movement, in which it
breaks apart, typically after
a period of some success,
because movement participants disagree about
whether essential goals
have really been achieved.<br>
5. Demise is the fifth stage
of a social movement, in
which it comes to an end
because it has achieved its
goal, lost popular support,
or been repressed.<br>
6. Revival is an additional
stage of some social
movements that occurs
if they re-emerge in the
same or a modified form.
