            <p class="job-description">
              Sociology is the study of groups and group interactions, societies and social interactions, from small and
              personal groups
              to very large groups. <br>
              The term
              sociology is a combination of two words. The first part of
              the term is a Latin, socius- that may variously mean
              society, association, togetherness or companionship.<br>
              The other word, logos, is of Greek origin. It literally
              means to speak about or word. <br>
              The concepts
              “society and “culture” are central in sociology.

            <p class="job-description">
              Since ancient times, people have been fascinated by the relationship between individuals and the societies
              to which they
              belong. Many topics studied in modern sociology were also studied by ancient philosophers in their desire
              to describe an
              ideal society, including theories of social conflict, economics, social cohesion, and power. <br>
              The first social scientist to use the term sociology was
              a Frenchman by the name of Auguste Comte who lived
              from 1798-1857. <br>
              Although the term “sociology” was first used by the
              French social philosopher august Comte, the discipline
              was more firmly established by such theorists as Emile
              Durkheim, Karl Marx and Max Weber.

            <p class="job-description">
              Generally, learning sociology provides us with what
              sociologists call the sociological imagination.
              Sociological imagination is a particular way of looking at
              the world around us through sociological lenses. It is a
              way of looking at our experiences in light of what is
              going on in the social world around us. This helps us to
              appreciate the social and non-biological forces that
              affect, influence and shape our lives as individuals,
              groups, and communities

              and Disciplines </h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Sociology occupies an important position among the
              disciplines, usually called the social sciences. These
              include sociology, anthropology, psychology,
              economics, political science, history and human
              geography. These disciplines are sometimes also
              referred to as behavioral sciences, as they study the
              principles governing human social behavior.

            <p class="job-description">
              As a general difference, we might say that while both disciplines are interested in human behavior,
              psychologists are
              focused on how the mind influences that behavior, while sociologists study the role of society in shaping
              behavior.
              Psychologists are interested in people’s mental development and how their minds process their world.
              Sociologists
              are more likely to focus on how different aspects of society contribute to an individual’s relationship
              with his world.

            <p class="job-description">
              Sociologists study social events, interactions, and patterns, and they develop a theory in an attempt to
              explain why things
              work as they do. In sociology, a theory is a way to explain different aspects of social interactions and
              to create a testable
              proposition, called a hypothesis, about society.
              <br>
              Theories vary in scope depending on the scale of the issues that they are meant to explain. Macro-level
              theories relate to
              large-scale issues and large groups of people, while micro-level theories look at very specific
              relationships between
              individuals or small groups

              In sociology, a few theories provide broad perspectives that help explain many different aspects of social
              life, and these are
              called paradigms. Paradigms are philosophical and theoretical frameworks used within a discipline to
              formulate theories,
              generalizations, and the experiments performed in support of them.

              parts designed to meet
              the biological and social needs of the individuals in that society. Functionalism grew out of the writings
              of English
              philosopher and biologist, Hebert Spencer, who saw similarities between society and the human
              body; he
              argued that just as the various organs of the body work together to keep the body functioning, the various
              parts of society
              work together to keep society functioning.

              approach most
              identified with the writings of German philosopher and sociologist Karl Marx (1818–1883), who saw society
              as being
              made up of individuals in different social classes who must compete for social, material, and political
              resources such as
              food and housing, employment, education, and leisure time.

              Symbolic interactionism is a micro-level theory that focuses on the relationships among individuals within
              a society.
              Communication—the exchange of meaning through language and symbols—is believed to be the way in which
              people

              make sense of their social worlds. Theorists Herman and Reynolds note that this perspective sees
              people as being
              active in shaping the social world rather than simply being acted upon.

              Constructivism is an extension of symbolic interaction theory which proposes that reality is what humans
              cognitively
              construct it to be. We develop social constructs based on interactions with others, and those constructs
              that last over time
              are those that have meanings which are widely agreed-upon or generally accepted by most within the
              society.

              One way researchers test social theories is by conducting an experiment, meaning they investigate
              relationships to test a hypothesis—a scientific approach.
              There are two main types of experiments: lab-based experiments and natural or field experiments.
              In a lab setting, the research can be controlled so that perhaps more data can be recorded in a certain
              amount of time. In a natural or field-based experiment, the generation of data cannot be controlled but
              the information might be considered more accurate since it was collected without interference or
              intervention by the researcher.

              Sociologists make use of tried and true methods of research, such as experiments, surveys, and field
              research. But humans and their social interactions are so diverse that they can seem impossible to chart
              or explain. It might seem that science is about discoveries and chemical reactions or about proving
              ideas right or wrong rather than about exploring the nuances of human behavior.

              A hypothesis is an assumption about how two or more variables are related; it makes a conjectural
              statement about the relationship between those variables. In sociology, the hypothesis will often predict
              how one form of human behavior influences another. In research, independent variables are the cause
              of the change. The dependent variable is the effect, or thing that is changed

              While many sociologists rely on the scientific method as a research approach, others operate from an
              interpretive framework. While systematic, this approach doesn’t follow the hypothesis-testing model
              that seeks to find generalizable results. Instead, an interpretive framework, sometimes referred to as an
              interpretive perspective, seeks to understand social worlds from the point of view of participants,
              leading to in-depth knowledge.

              scientific research methods. The standard survey format allows individuals a level of anonymity in

              While sociologists often engage in original research studies, they also contribute knowledge to the
              discipline through secondary data analysis. Secondary data don’t result from firsthand research
              collected from primary sources, but are the already completed work of other researchers. Sociologists
              might study works written by historians, economists, teachers, or early sociologists. They might search
              through periodicals, newspapers, or magazines from any period in history.

              In a causal relationship, one variable actually causes the other to occur.
              Three standards are commonly used to determine causal relationships. <br>
              Standard 1: Two variables must be correlated. Some researchers found
              that juvenile delinquency increases as church attendance declines—a
              negative correlation.<br>
              Standard 2: All other possible factors must be taken into account. The

              Humans are social creatures. Since the dawn of Homo sapiens nearly 250,000 years ago, people have grouped
              together
              into communities in order to survive. Living together, people form common habits and behaviors—from
              specific methods
              of childrearing to preferred techniques for obtaining food.

            <p class="job-description">
              People often misuse the concept of
              culture. Some misconceptions about the to term culture
              include: <br>
              1. Many people in the western world use the term
              culture in the sense that some people are more
              "cultured" than others. When one is said to
              be “cultured”, he or she is said to be civilized. <br>
              2. A second commonly used misconception is that
              which equates “culture" with things which are
              colorful, customs, cloths, foods, dancing, music,
              etc. <br>
              3. A third misconception about what culture is and
              what it constitutes is that which may be
              entertained by many common people here in
              Ethiopia. This misconception is similar to the
              second one, but it differs from it in that most
              people here think culture
              is that which pertains to unique traditional
              material objects or non – material things of the
              past.

            <p class="job-description">
              People with the best intentions sometimes travel to a society to “help” its
              people, because
              they see them as uneducated or backward—essentially inferior. In reality, these travelers are guilty of
              cultural
              imperialism, the deliberate imposition of one’s own cultural values on another culture. Europe’s colonial
              expansion,
              begun in the sixteenth century, was often accompanied by a severe cultural imperialism. European
              colonizers often viewed
              the people in the lands they colonized as uncultured savages who were in need of European governance,
              dress, religion,
              and other cultural practices. <br>
              The global culture may
              entail all speaking the some language, share the same
              values and norms, and sustain common und of
              knowledge as of residents of the same community
              . Global culture may also be associated
              with cultural imperialism, the unequal cultural
              exchange in the global system whereby western
              material and non-material cultures have come to occupy
              a dominating and imposing roles over the indigenous
              cultures of the Third World peoples.
              The global culture is often promoted by: <br>
              - The global spread of capitalism <br>
              - Consumerism and the consumer culture <br>
              - The growth of transnational media, particularly

              Lead </h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Culture is dynamic. When culture change occurs, the
              change is usually not evenly distributed across material
              and non-material dimensions of culture. The rate of
              change is not balanced. Material culture may change at
              a faster rate than non- material culture. The growth in
              science and technology in western, industrialized
              societies for example, does not seem to be matched by
              the necessary changes and appropriate adjustment of
              adaptive culture. That is non-material culture changes
              slowly. This condition is termed as culture lag.

              <br>
              On the other hand, in some less developed societies,
              the change of non-material culture may outpace the
              material culture. When this occurs, it is called culture
              lead. Due to the effect of globalization and rapid
              assimilation processes, people in the Third World are
              accustomed to the ideology and cultures of the Western
              World, though their material culture is not changing
              keeping pace with non- material culture.

              High culture consists of things that are generally associated with the social elite.
              The opera, cotillions or debutante balls, classical music and literature, wine tastings, and the fine arts

            <p class="job-description">
              A subculture is just as it sounds—a smaller cultural group within a larger culture; people of a
              subculture are part of the larger culture, but also share a specific identity within a smaller group.
              Thousands of subcultures exist within the United States. Ethnic and racial groups share the
              language, food, and customs of their heritage. <br>
              Sociologists distinguish subcultures from countercultures, which are a type of subculture that
              rejects some of the larger culture’s norms and values. In contrast to subcultures, which operate
              relatively smoothly within the larger society, countercultures might actively defy larger society by
              developing their own set of rules and norms to live by, sometimes even creating communities that

              Socialization is the process through which people are taught to be proficient members of a society. It

              Socialization is critical both to individuals and to the societies in which they live. It illustrates how
              completely intertwined
              human beings and their social worlds are.
              Socialization is just as essential to us as individuals. Social interaction provides the means via which
              we gradually become
              able to see ourselves through the eyes of others, and how we learn who we are and how we fit into the
              world around us. In
              addition, to function successfully in society, we have to learn the basics of both material and
              nonmaterial culture,
              everything from how to dress ourselves to what’s suitable attire for a specific occasion.

              Social groups often provide the first experiences of socialization. Families, and later peer groups,
              communicate
              expectations and reinforce norms. People first learn to use the tangible objects of material culture in

              school, or serves
              time in jail. In the new environment, the old rules no longer apply. The process of resocialization is
              typically more
              stressful than normal socialization because people have to unlearn behaviors that have become customary to
              them.

            <p class="job-description">
              The term group is an amorphous one and can refer to a wide variety of gatherings, from just two people, a
              club, a regular gathering of friends,
              or people who
              work together or share a hobby. In short, the term refers to any collection of at least two people who
              interact with some
              frequency and who share a sense that their identity is somehow aligned with the group.

            <h3 class="mb-0">Primary vs. Secondary Groups</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              A primary group is a group in which one exchanges implicit items, such as love, caring, concern, support,
              etc. Examples of these would be family groups and love relationships, crisis. Relationships formed in
              primary
              groups are often long lasting and goals in themselves. <br>
              Unlike first groups, secondary groups are large groups whose relationships are impersonal and goal
              oriented. People in a secondary group interact on a less personal level than in a primary group, and their
              relationships are generally temporary rather than long lasting.

            <p class="job-description">
              Sociologist William Sumner developed the concepts of in-group and
              out-group to explain this phenomenon. In short, an in-group is the group that an individual
              feels she
              belongs to, and she believes it to be an integral part of who she is. An out-group, conversely, is a group
              someone doesn’t
              belong to; often we may feel disdain or competition in relationship to an out-group.

            <p class="job-description">
              People who exist in the same place at the same time but who do not interact or share
              a sense of identity—such as a bunch of people standing in line at Starbucks—are considered an aggregate,
              or a crowd.

              Another example of a nongroup is people who share similar characteristics but are not tied to one another
              in any way.
              These people are considered a category, and as an example all children born from approximately 1980–2000
              are referred
              to as “Millennials.” Why are Millennials a category and not a group? Because while some of them may share
              a sense of
              identity, they do not, as a whole, interact frequently with each other.

            <p class="job-description">
              A reference group is a group that people compare themselves to—it provides a standard of measurement. In
              U.S. society,
              peer groups are common reference groups. Kids and adults pay attention to what their peers wear, what
              music they like,
              what they do with their free time—and they compare themselves to what they see.
              Some other examples of reference groups can be one’s cultural center, workplace, family gathering, and
              even parents

              Social processes are certain repetitive, continuous

              Social processes may be manifested in a number of
              ways. There are generally five modes of social
              processes. These are competition, conflict, cooperation,
              accommodation and assimilation. These are universal
              modes; they take place at micro and macro levels.

              Social stratification is the segmentation of society into
              different hierarchical arrangement or strata. It refers to
              the differences and inequalities in the socioeconomic life
              of people in a given society. It represents the ranking of
              individuals or social positions and statuses in the social
              structure.

              membership. <br>
              It is a process by which
