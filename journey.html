              Starting a Journey; The Art of Letting Go
            </h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              When I left my country in 2015, I learned some important lessons. One of those was the "art of letting go"
              I was a person that liked to keep things and made my space cluttered. I probably learned that from my
              family. Although that habit wasn't so extreme, it was a problem that I hadn't been aware of for years.
              After I bought my airline tickets from Mashhad to Vienna, suddenly I realized I only have two pieces of
              luggage of a maximum 30 kg weight and a few days to pack everything. It felt overwhelming at first, but I
              thought, "wait a minute, who cares about a bunch of trash when I'm leaving my home, family, and friends."
              That moment was a huge relief that gave me the power to minimize my belongings and experienced so much joy
              in having less. I gave most of my stuff to others who need them, but sentimental things to people I loved
              because I knew what has value for me should stay with whom I valued myself. It was the most enjoyable
              moment of this process. I had heard that from my father that "Love is when you can give someone your most
              valuable things and being happy just by doing it."

              My Minimalism Philosophy
            </h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Since the summer of 2015, when I moved to California from Europe, I have moved into different homes
              several times. Almost every year, I had to change my place, and although I didn't own so much stuff, I was
              stressed out each time that I was supposed to move to a different house. I had to spend a lot of my time
              packing my thing and being worried about the big moving day.
              In my last move from Irvine to Sacramento, I decided to keep the things I need and get rid of the extra
              and unnecessary items. Later I became interested in learning about minimalism philosophy and lifestyle.
              As a minimalist, I can say I am at the starting point of my journey to
              live a simpler and happier life.
              So, what is minimalism anyway?
              There is no right or wrong answer to this question. Everyone has own interpretation of this concept.
              However, I define minimalism such that as a minimalist,
              I am removing the distraction of excess possessions so I can focus more on those things that matter most.
              Minimalism is all about freedom.
              Minimalism isn't an end point.
              It's a constant process of editing, revisiting,
              editing some more.

              What Makes Me Happy
            </h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              I'm a minimalist.
              I wake up in the morning in a
              room that lacks clutter, in the quiet of the
              early morning, have coffee, read a few pages of my book,
              and begin working remotely as a Software Engineer, then go out
              for a walk in the afternoon, take a shower, and have dinner.
              Then I might relax, meditate, listen to music,
              watch a movie, read some more, write what comes to mind,
              or spend quality time with my loved ones.
              These are the things that make me happy.
              Not buying a lot of things. Not traveling all
              the time, nor going to parties or spending
              money on expensive entertainment. Not
              watching a lot of television and being
              bombarded with ads. Others might find joy
              in these things, and I'm not criticizing them.
              I'm just stating what makes me happy.
              And that's the key. Figure out what makes
              you happy. Get rid of the rest, so you have
              room for those important things. It's not a life
              of nothing, of boringness. It's a life of
              richness, in less.
              Your life may be different than
              mine. You'll need to figure out what makes
              you happiest. Plan your ideal day. Then strip
              your life of the non-essentials, to make room
              for this ideal day, for the things and people
              you love.

            <h3 class="mb-0">The Art of Well-Being</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Today, I was listening to Radio Hamrah when a young woman called to ask about her marriage, and how her
              partner insisted on a prenup. For those who don't know, a prenuptial agreement, commonly referred to as a
              prenup, is a written contract you and your spouse enter into before getting legally married. It details
              exactly what happens to finances and assets during your marriage and, of course, in
              the event of divorce.
              Although in some cases, a prenup can help, most of the time can be destructive. The funny thing is that
              those people don't understand that by marrying someone they share their life with someone, their children,
              and their moments. All the moments that could potentially hurt them. The question is "Why do you trust to
              share your life with someone, while
              you cannot share your property with them?"
              We as humans, like other animals have needs that should be satisfied, especially as Mazlo pointed out, our
              physiological needs are essential for our being. The second level is related to security and safety.
              If you satisfied those needs you can go to upper levels like love and belongings, self-esteem, and so on.
              Finally, you get to the point that
              satisfying the need is not essential for being but it improves the state of your well-being or becoming.
              Only the first level is about owning things, and you can satisfy your security need by owning more
              material. Self-actualization is the highest level that you and only you are worth. You think about
              yourself as something far more valuable than materials like your house, car, etc. We can simply understand
              that the person who does not pass the second level can not be in a state that can love and be loved.
              Although many of them do not agree with that. However, if you cannot trust someone with your money, your
              marriage is not at the third level and about love. You see your partner as an object to become more secure
              by having them. Such people have very low self-esteem. They don't love themselves and cannot believe that
              someone can love them because, in their point of view, they are worthless. Nobody. Nothing. Therefore, if
              someone comes close to them, it must be about what they own.
