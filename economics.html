              Every society must provide goods and services for the welfare of its
              citizens. The economy consists of all of the activities involved in the

            <h3 class="mb-0">Economics</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Economics is a study of certain aspects of society. Adam Smith (1723 - 1790), the "father of
              modern economics" and author of the famous book "An Inquiry into the Nature
              and Causes of the Wealth of Nations", spawned the discipline of economics by
              trying to understand why some nations prospered while others lagged behind in
              poverty. Others after him also explored how a nation's allocation of resources
              affects its wealth.
              To study these things, economics makes the assumption that human beings will
              aim to fulfill their self-interests. It also assumes that individuals are rational in
              their efforts to fulfill their unlimited wants and needs. Economics, therefore, is a
              social science, which examines people behaving according to their self-interests.

            <h3 class="mb-0">Scarcity</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Scarcity refers to the tension between our limited resources and our unlimited
              wants and needs. For an individual, resources include time, money and skill. For
              a country, limited resources include natural resources, capital, labor force and
              technology.
              Because all of our resources are limited in comparison to all of our wants and
              needs, individuals and nations have to make decisions regarding what goods and
              services they can buy and which ones they must forgo.

            <h3 class="mb-0">Macro and Microeconomics</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Macroeconomics focuses on trying to understand events that affect the
              whole economy.
              Macroeconomics looks at the total output of a nation and the way
              the nation allocates its limited resources of land, labor and capital in an attempt to maximize production
              levels and promote trade and growth for future
              generations. After observing the society as a whole, Adam Smith noted that there
              was an "invisible hand" turning the wheels of the economy: a market force that
              keeps the economy functioning.
              Microeconomics looks into similar issues, but on the level of the individual people
              and firms within the economy. It tends to be more scientific in its approach, and
              studies the parts that make up the whole economy. Analyzing certain aspects of
              human behavior, microeconomics shows us how individuals and firms respond to
              changes in price and why they demand what they do at particular price levels.

            <p class="job-description">
              Nature of economics refers to whether economics is a science or art or both, and if it is a science,
              whether it is positive science or normative science or both.
              <br><br>
              Economics as a Science: <br>
              Economics as a social science studies economic activities of the people.
              This is a systematic body of knowledge as it explains cause and effect relationship between
              various variables such as price, demand, supply, money supply, production, national income,
              employment, etc.
              <br><br>
              Economics as an Art:<br>
              Various branches of economics, like consumption, production, distribution, money and banking,
              public finance, etc., provide us basic rules and guidelines which can be used to solve various
              economic problems of the society.
              <br><br>
              Economics as a Positive Science:<br>
              A positive science is that science in which analysis is confined to cause and effect relationship.
              Positive economics is concerned with the facts about the economy.
              It studies the economic phenomena as they exist,
              finds out the common characteristics of economic events,
              and specifies cause and effect relationship between them.
              <br><br>
              Economics as a Normative Science:<br>
              Normative economics involves value judgment.
              It deals primarily with economic goals of a society and policies to achieve these goals.
              It also prescribes the methods to correct undesirable economic happenings.

            <p class="job-description">
              In case of any economy, whatever the economy required cannot be satisfied fully.
              Economic resources or means of production are limited and they can be put to alternative uses.
              Every economy faces some common problems. <br>
              What to
              produce? A country cannot produce all goods because it has limited resources.
              It has to make a choice between different goods and services.
              Every economy has to decide what goods and services should be produced. <br>
              How to
              produce? As an economy decides to produce certain goods, it faces the problem to decide
              how these goods will be produced.
              The problem arises because of unavailability of some resources.
              It also involves the choice of technique of production.
              A country may produce by labour intensive methods or by capital intensive methods
              of production, depending upon its stock or man power. <br>
              For whom to
              produce? Goods and services are produced for people who have the means to pay for them.
              A country may produce mass consumption goods at a large scale or goods for
              upper classes.
              All it depends upon the policies of the government as well as private producing units.

            <p class="job-description">
              Welfare means the satisfaction or the well-being enjoyed by society.
              Social welfare depends on the wealth of the nation.
              In general, wealth gives rise to welfare, although they are not same.
              If wealth of society increases, but the distribution among the citizens of the country is very unequal,
              this inequality may create social jealousy and tension.
              Economists, however, assume that when wealth increases, welfare increases too.
              Similarly, when wealth decreases, welfare is assumed to decrease.

              made in fixed assets like machineries, factory sheds etc. is called fixed investment.
              By deducting depreciation cost, of capital from the gross investment, we get new investment.<br>

            <p class="job-description">
              A trade-off is a situational decision that involves diminishing or losing one quality, quantity, or
              property of a set or design in return for gains in other aspects. In simple terms, a tradeoff is where one
              thing increases, and another must decrease.

              When economists refer to the “opportunity cost” of a resource, they mean the value of the
              next-highest-valued alternative use of that resource. If, for example, you spend time and money going to a
              movie, you cannot spend that time at home reading a book, and you can't spend the money on something else.

            <p class="job-description">
              Supply is a fundamental economic concept that describes the total amount of a specific good or service
              that is available to consumers. Supply can relate to the amount available at a specific price or the
              amount available across a range of prices if displayed on a graph. This relates closely to the demand for
              a good or service at a specific price; all else being equal, the supply provided by producers will rise if
              the price rises because all firms look to maximize profits.

              Demand is an economic principle referring to a consumer's desire to purchase goods and services and
              willingness to pay a price for a specific good or service. Holding all other factors constant, an increase
              in the price of a good or service will decrease the quantity demanded, and vice versa.

              Equilibrium is the state in which market supply and demand balance each other, and as a result prices
              become stable. Generally, an over-supply of goods or services causes prices to go down, which results in
              higher demand—while an under-supply or shortage causes prices to go up resulting in less demand. The
              balancing effect of supply and demand results in a state of equilibrium.

              Elasticity is a measure of a variable's sensitivity to a change in another variable, most commonly this
              sensitivity is the change in price relative to changes in other factors. In business and economics,
              elasticity refers to the degree to which individuals, consumers, or producers change their demand or the
              amount supplied in response to price or income changes. It is predominantly used to assess the change in
              consumer demand as a result of a change in a good or service's price.

              Keynes during the 1930s in an attempt to understand the Great Depression.

              Microeconomics is the social science that studies the implications of incentives and decisions,
              specifically about how those affect the utilization and distribution of resources. Microeconomics shows
              how and why different goods have different values, how individuals and businesses conduct and benefit from
              efficient production and exchange, and how individuals best coordinate and cooperate with one another.
              Generally speaking, microeconomics provides a more complete and detailed understanding than
              macroeconomics.

              The law of supply and demand is a theory that explains the interaction between the sellers of a resource
              and the buyers for that resource. The theory defines the relationship between the price of a given good or
              product and the willingness of people to either buy or sell it. Generally, as price increases people are
              willing to supply more and demand less and vice versa when the price falls.

              The theory was first developed by the French economist Leon Walras in the late 19th century. It stands in
              contrast with partial equilibrium theory, or Marshallian partial equilibrium, which only analyzes specific
              markets or sectors.

              Incentives and behaviors: How people, as individuals or in firms, react to the situations with which they
              are confronted. <br>
              Utility theory: Consumers will choose to purchase and consume a combination of goods that will maximize
              their happiness or “utility,” subject to the constraint of how much income they have available to spend.
              <br>
              Production theory: This is the study of production—or the process of converting inputs into outputs.
              Producers seek to choose the combination of inputs and methods of combining them that will minimize cost
              in order to maximize their profits. <br>
              Price theory: Utility and production theory interact to produce the theory of supply and demand, which
              determine prices in a competitive market. In a perfectly competitive market, it concludes that the price
              demanded by consumers is the same supplied by producers. That results in economic equilibrium.

              price levels, rate of economic growth, national income, gross domestic product (GDP), and changes in
              unemployment.

            <p class="job-description">
              Inflation is the decline of purchasing power of a given currency over time. A quantitative estimate of the
              rate at which the decline in purchasing power occurs can be reflected in the increase of an average price
              level of a basket of selected goods and services in an economy over some period of time. The rise in the
              general level of prices, often expressed a a percentage means that a unit of currency effectively buys
              less than it did in prior periods.
              Inflation can be contrasted with deflation, which occurs when the purchasing power of money increases and
              prices decline.
              Deflation is a general decline in prices for goods and services, typically associated with a contraction
              in the supply of money and credit in the economy. During deflation, the purchasing power of currency rises
              over time.

              the number of goods or services you would be able to purchase.

              world is also decidedly complicated and includes matters of social preference and conscience that do not
