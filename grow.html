              What a Software Engineer needs to know
            </h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              As a Junior Software Engineer and an entry-level employee in a start-up tech company in Silicon Valley, I
              soon realized that what I learned in university is crucial but certainly not enough. Especially, in a
              dynamic and competitive market like software and technology-based jobs, you need to improve your knowledge
              every day no matter how much experience and expertise you have. As it hasn't been a long time since I
              graduated, I still look at myself as a student and have a craving and passion for learning new things.
              Based on my research, there are some topics that you need to know and be a master of as a Software
              Engineer. Those things don't change too often and are the basis of your knowledge. My list includes the
              following topics. <br><br>
              1. Data Structures and Algorithms<br>
              2. Programming Concepts and Fundamentals<br>
              3. Software Architecture<br>
              4. Software Design Patterns<br>
              5. Database Systems<br>

              What a Junior Software Engineer needs to learn
            </h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              In addition to what a Software Engineer should know as the basis of the job, some topics can change quite
              rapidly depending on the growth of technology and its requirements. Therefore, it would be vitally
              important for a professional to understand what subject to pick and how much time to spend to learn a
              specific skill. Keep that in mind technology has always been a tool for humans to achieve their goals and
              satisfy their needs and desires. As societies develop, humans' needs will change, and the previous tools
              become useless or inefficient. I have a list of tools that need to be updated based on their efficiency
              and compatibility.<br><br>
              1. Programming Languages<br>
              2. Frameworks and Libraries<br>
              3. IDEs and Code Developing Environments<br>
              4. Clould Computing Platforms<br>
              5. UX / UI Design Software<br>
              6. Linux Command Line and BASH Scripting

              What is "the Shell"? <br>
              Simply put, the shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating
              system to perform. In the old days, it was the only user interface available on a Unix-like system such as
              Linux. On Mac and Linux systems, we access the command line through something called Bash.<br><br>

            <p class="job-description">
              1. Know the domain of the problem: Software is just a tool for solving domain problems. If you understand
              a domain well
              and
              are passionate
              about it, you’ll be a much
              better, more motivated developer. <br>
              2. Breakdown a complex problem: Take a complex problem, break it down into smaller pieces, solve each of
              those
              pieces, and then put everything back together to solve the initial problem. <br>


              3. Plan your code away from the computer: It will help you build a clear mental model before you start.
              When you're stuck, write your program on paper. It works because when you don't have to think about
              syntax.
              <br>
              4. You need to know how things work: You should know the front end (UI), the back end,
              the data store, the OS, any
              virtualization layers, the hardware, the network, and the data center.<br><br>

            <p class="job-description">
              Design thinking is a non-linear, iterative process that consists of 5 phases: <br>
              1. Empathize <br>
              2. Define <br>
              3. Ideate<br>
              4. Prototype <br>
              5. Test<br><br>
              Design thinking is essentially a problem-solving approach that has the intention to improve products. It’s a process that digs a bit deeper into problem-solving as you seek to understand your users, challenge assumptions and redefine problems. Design thinking asks us to understand and challenge our natural, restrictive patterns of thinking and generate innovative solutions to the problems our users face.
