              <strong>Abstract: </strong>
              The research community on the study and design of systems for personal informatics has grown over the past
              decade. To take stock of what the topics the field has studied and methods the field has used, we map and
              label
              523 publications from ACM's library, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed. We surface that the literature has focused
              on
              studying and designing for health and wellness domains, an emphasis on understanding and overcoming
              barriers
              to
              data collection and reflection, and progressively fewer contributions involving artifacts being made. Our
              mapping review suggests directions future research could explore, such as identifying and resolving
              barriers
              to
              tracking stages beyond collection and reflection, engaging more with domain experts, and further
              discussing
              the
              privacy and ethical concerns around tracked data.

              for organizing, categorizing, and improving the study as it provides an opportunity for scholars to access
              the

                Infrastructure</a>
            </h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              In this paper I tried to explain the importance of infrastructure in the 21st century and answer
              the following questions: <br>
              What makes up infrastructure? <br> What is its purpose? <br> Why is it essential? <br> How does it evolve
              and
              change?
              <br>
              As technology has improved and the internet becomes part of our lives, the notion of infrastructure has
              been generalized to the world of information technology and, as a result, IT infrastructure was
              introduced.
              In the 21st century, many people take advantage of using IT infrastructure, without consciously being
              aware of its existence, and the significance of its role in shaping society. - <a

                Technology</a>
            </h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              The concept of technology has been used broadly and repeatedly. Society, on the other hand, has its own
              meaning especially when is used in relation with effects of technology. In this article, I addressed some
              of these problems: <br>
              Is technology an abstract concept? <br>What about society? <br>Do technology and society exist in two
              separate
              worlds?<br> Does technology control our lives directly? <br>
              Technology exists as a medium that has been designed, created, shaped, evolved and more importantly
              adapted by society throughout history. Society itself is an essential factor in terms of its adaption with
              technology and the extent it is impacted by technological innovations. In fact, as society creates
              technology, technology can be used by people to reshape civilization.- <a
