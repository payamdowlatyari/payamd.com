            The Psychology of Silicon Valley offers a revealing look inside the mind of world’s most influential industry and how the identity, culture, myths, and motivations of Big Tech are harming society.             
            <br><br><br><strong>My Review:</strong>
            <br />
            As a software engineer working at a start-up in Silicon Valley, this book gave me valuable insight. The author pays good attention to the psychological issues of the most intelligent and successful individuals in the nation. Lack of emotional intelligence and selfishness cause serious issues in the working environment. Unhealthy competitions demand employees who work like machines with a limited sense of empathy for others. Goal-oriented engineers and self-centered CEOs walk in the streets of the San Francisco Bay Area in front of hundreds of homeless people every day without even noticing them.

              by Johann Hari</a><br/>
              <strong> My rating:</strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4112921408"> 5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
              Award-winning journalist Johann Hari suffered from depression since he was a teenager.
              He was told that his problem was caused by a chemical imbalance in his brain. Later he began to investigate this question.           
              Across the world, Hari discovered social scientists who were uncovering the real causes—and they are mostly not in our brains, but in the way we live today.
             
            <br><br><strong>My Review:</strong>
            <br />
            This is an amazing book about human behaviors resulting from our lifestyle that might eventually cause depression in people in the modern world. Studies show that a large number of people, who suffer from depression, have a severe lack of ability to reason and think logically. Hari mentions interesting facts about our animal side and how disconnection from nature can cause depressed moods. Although, in my opinion, the author is a bit too much against medication therapy, some of the topics he says would help people who suffer from depression.

              stars</a><br /><br />
              In Sapiens, Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the 
              radical – and sometimes devastating – breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. 
            <br><br><br><strong>My Review:</strong>
            <br />
            I believe Sapians is a masterpiece and a must-read for whoever wants to know how homo-sepians evolved and human civilization developed for thousands or even millions of years. 
            The book is well-written and easy to follow. The author's analysis and explanations are based on scientific evidence and historical facts. 
            In Sepians, Harari emphasizes the importance of narratives and storytelling in shaping and strengthening human relations and establishing early civilizations. He analyzes the role of religions in communicating and expanding those stories and forming extensive groups of people having similar attitudes and sharing the same beliefs and behaviors. History shows us how cultures grew because of interaction between homo-sepians and even people gossiping played a crucial role in creating, telling, and repeating those stories over and over and fictional stories that helped them become united and function organically as societies and nationalities. In brief and in my opinion, the gist of this book is what differentiated human beings from other animals were the power of storytelling. Storytelling is what made homo-sepians the most dominant creatures on earth.

              Yuval Noah Harari's 21 Lessons for the 21st Century is a probing and visionary investigation into today's
              most urgent issues as we move into the uncharted territory of the future.
              <br><br><br><strong>My Review:</strong><br>
              One of the finest books I've ever read. Harari explains the most complex philosophical concepts in a
              simple
              and understandable language. His point of view on ideological and religious beliefs is completely neutral,
              fair, and based on logic, evidence, and scientific approach rather than prejudices.
              In this book, the author discusses 21 fundamental topics such as religion, education, politics, democracy,
              nationalism, technology, and so on. He argues the way people's lives are impacted by fixed ideas,
              mindsets, and schools of thought. Also, he points out how sepians evolved and how their evolution shaped
              society, individuals, and cultures.
              Harari's arguments and conclusions are based upon reality, science, and open-mindedness, and he defends
              the liberty, freedom, and dignity of a human being.

              A fascinating exploration of how computer algorithms can be applied to our everyday lives, helping to
              solve common decision-making problems and illuminate the workings of the human mind.
              <br><br><br><strong>My Review:</strong>
              <br>
              Decision-making is one of the most critical functions of our mind. In this book, the authors clearly show
              how peoples' minds are programmed. The whole idea of algorithm design is about how our minds process and
              the steps we use to overcome challenges. Psychology explains how humans' minds operate when it comes to
              tasks that are difficult but common. We need to solve a problem once by finding the proper steps, remember
              them, and use them any time we face the same or similar problems. This idea is how computers work.
              Computers are programmed to make our life easier by completing tasks faster as a result of the combination
              of the power of the mind and the functionality of microprocessors that use with multiple levels of
              software. Authors go over the most crucial concepts of data structures and algorithms like searching,
              sorting, optimizing, graphs, etc., and show how such ideas were born.
              Although the literature is fairly simple, smooth, and does not include too many technical words and
              phrases, its concepts can be somehow difficult for readers with no or limited background in computer
              science and mathematics.

              Humans of New York is a photoblog and book of street portraits and interviews collected on the streets of
              New York City.
              <br> <br><br><strong>My Review:</strong> <br>
              Amazing book for people who are interested in photography, especially street photography, and also the
              ones
              who
              like to read true stories about individuals with all the similarities and differences. New York City is
              the best location for street photography. It is one of the most diverse cities in the world with people
              from different cultures, social statuses, and nationalities.
              This book is an album full of colorful, exceptional, and artistic photos.
              Each person has a unique story to tell. Each photo captures a moment of that person's life, showing a
              specific feeling. Each photograph is associated with a caption and has a little story about the subject.
              Captions give you more, less, or no information about it.
              One of the most impactful lessons I learned from the author of this book is there is nothing better than
              humans for photography.

              The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem is a psychology book written by Dr. Nathaniel Branden. Dr. Branden is known
              as the "father" of the Self-Esteem movement and this book is his most popular work.
              <br> <br><br> <br> <strong>My Review:</strong> <br>
              Everybody should read this book, especially people with low self-esteem. Most psychological disorders such
              as depression, anxiety, and anger come from a lack of self-esteem. During a person's mental development,
              most babies between the age of one and three years old received millions of signals from other people
              regarding their weaknesses. Because children make mistakes and others correct them, they think they are
              bad. In the next stages of development, as what Piage introduced as the preoperational, concrete, and
              formal operational stages, the bad feeling of a child must be recovered by positive messages from parents,
              friends, and the educational system. Otherwise, the person could suffer from a low-esteem.
              In this book, Dr. Brandon provides a scientific and empirical method for building one's self-esteem as an
              adult.
