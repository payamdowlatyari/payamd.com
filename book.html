          <strong> My rating:</strong>  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5266955203">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />

          In Understanding Power, Peter Mitchell and John Schoeffel have assembled the best of Chomsky's recent talks on the past, present, and future of the politics of power.

                  <strong>My Review:</strong>
                  <br/>
       
                  I admire Chomsky as an activist, linguist, philosopher, and scholar. He has been of the rare public figures in the United States that has the knowledge and capacity to connect the dots on different events by fact-checking rather than what the media tries to make us believe. 
                  Chomsky looks at the processes throughout history rather than single events and reveals the underlying reasons and intentions of the politicians based on many factors including but not limited to history, ideology, facts retrieved from different reliable sources such as outdated official documents belonging to intelligence agencies, foreign newspapers, and firsthand data from people who were directly involved in circumstances. 
                  This book is based on multiple questions and answer sessions that took place in the late 20th and early 21st centuries on many interesting topics linked to power and international relations, history, concepts such as Anarchism, Socialism, and Capitalism, and the influence of the media in spreading misinformation, disinformation to serve the power.

              Henry Kissinger offers in World Order a deep meditation on the roots of international harmony and global disorder. 
          
               <br/><br/>
                  <strong>My Review:</strong>
                  <br/>
                  Henry Kissinger is one of the most well-known and controversial politicians and scholars in the United States. 
                  His realistic approach to changing international relations was practical and innovative when he was the secretary of state in Nixon's administration. 
                  Also, as an academic, he has extensive knowledge of other countries. 
                  I personally learned a lot from this book, specifically from chapters related to Iran, the Middle East, and China. 
                  However, I think Kissinger is not entirely honest about things that occurred in Vietnam, Cuba, and other third-world countries in Asia, and Latin America. 
                  Although he is not lying about the events, he tries to rationalize the U.S.'s violent acts in those countries.

                Unpacks and pulls the curtain back on what happens to our brains and our behaviors each time we addictively engage social media and the influencers we encounter there.               
                 <br/><br/>
                    <strong>My Review:</strong>
                    <br/>
                    Dr. Wachler is a physician/influencer known for fact-checking on social media, especially on TikTok. 
                    He creates videos to educate people on social media to improve their critical thinking skills so that they can differentiate misinformation and disinformation from facts. 
                    The author introduces a concept name Perceptional Intelligence. PI signifies a person's ability to know when to follow the action of a large group versus heading off on their own. 
                    In other words, it means independent critical thinking and decision-making capacity. 
                    In his analysis, Dr. Wachler used multiple reliable sources and his interviews with successful influencers from different groups and professions. 
                    I personally, enjoyed and learned a lot from the first ten chapters of the book. 
                    In the last two chapters, the author discusses topics such as "how to be a good influencer" and the like, which I think are not worth reading as much as the previous ones. 
                    Overall, I recommend Influenced to everyone, especially young influencers and teenagers.

              Here, internationally respected author Abbas Milani gives us the definitive biography, more than ten years in the making, of the monarch who shaped Iran's modern age and with it the contemporary politics of the Middle East.
                  <br/><br/>
                  <strong>My Review:</strong>
                  <br/>
                  Dr. Milani is an outstanding scholar and Iranian professor at Stanford University. 
                  In this book, he authors a detailed and analytical biography of the last monarch of Iran who had to flee the country after the government's overthrow in 1979 which led to the Islamic Revolution in Iran. 
                  Milani carefully describes the story from different perspectives and based on reliable sources and has a fair attitude for admiring or criticizing the Shah's actions as a head of state for 37 years. 
                  This book narrates the public and personal life of the Shah in parallel so the readers have a better understanding of the Shah's situations at critical points during his reign.

            Why are many of the most successful people plagued by feelings of emptiness and alienation? This wise and profound book has provided thousands of readers with an answer and has helped them to apply it to their own lives.
            Far too many of us had to learn as children to hide our own feelings, needs, and memories skillfully in order to meet our parents’ expectations and win their ”love.”
            <br/><br/><br/>
                <strong>My Review:</strong>
                <br/>
                Children with relatively high intelligence may suffer more during their childhood. 
                As a result, they have to deal with anxiety and depression later and during their adulthood. 
                In this book, Alice Miller explains how sensitive children can damage psychologically by decent parents whose behaviors are quite normal in society. 
                What parents and other caregivers must know is that an infant lives in a totally different world than grown-ups.

            From Simon & Schuster, Taking Responsibility is Nathaniel Branden's guide to self-reliance and the accountable life, including self-realization through that self-reliance, offering a vision of society transformed by a new ethical individualism.

            <br/><br/><br/>
                <strong>My Review:</strong>
                <br/>
                Taking Responsibility is another well-written and practical book by Nathaniel Brandon whose efforts and teachings have been guiding many people including myself to have a better understanding of life and learn a more satisfactory way of living. 
                The most significant lesson I learned from this book, was the fact that taking responsibility is, without any doubt, our only road to freedom and liberty. 
                The author has a famous quote that states, "Nobody is coming!". That means, I should take care of myself and I am responsible for my own physical and mental well-being always and forever.

            Living consciously means seeking to be aware of everything that bears on our actions, purposes, values, and goals - and behaving in accordance with that which we see and know. 
            In The Art of Living Consciously, Dr. Nathaniel Branden takes us into new territory, exploring the actions of our minds when they are operating as our life and well-being require - and also when they are not.
                <br/><br/><br/>
                <strong>My Review:</strong>
                <br/>
                I am a student of Dr. Brandon. Like other books I have read from the author, his main focus was on self-esteem and self-confidence. 
                He points out that our destructing behaviors are rooted in our unconscious way of living. 
                Likewise, we can easily avoid many mistakes only by exercising to bring awareness to our actions. 
                He introduces a technique that has been amazingly beneficial to many of his clients in decades of psychotherapy practice which is sentence completion. 
                For example, "If I bring 5% more awareness to my profession, [and one should continue with everything that is grammatically correct as many as possible]".

            Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner has been acclaimed as the most influential educational theorist since John Dewey. 
            His ideas about intelligence and creativity have revolutionized our thinking. 
            In his groundbreaking 1983 book Frames of Mind , Howard Gardner first introduced the theory of multiple intelligences, which posits that intelligence is more than a single property of the human mind.
               
                <br/><br/><br/>
                <strong>My Review:</strong>
                <br/>
                The idea of Multiple Intelligences has been one of the twentieth century's most influential and controversial theories in cognitive psychology. 
                Before introducing such an idea, almost everyone including teachers, parents, students, and even psychologists and other scientists like biologists and anthropologists thought there was only one type of intelligence that could be measured by IQ tests. 
                Professor Gardner, who is a Harvard professor and researcher, shows that we as animals and human beings can have a wide range of intelligence. 
                Unlike what most psychometricians believe, IQ tests could only show one or two parts of our intelligence which are mathematical and linguistics. 
                Interestingly, one must be relatively well in those areas in order to have success in school. In fact, the importance of IQ is when a child faces issues in learning. 
                In his book, Gardner explains why we should provide opportunities for children to grow abilities in multiple areas. 
                I personally think the book was very informative and well written but the last two chapters were a bit vague and the author repeated some of the concepts much more than needed.

                Much of what will happen in the next thirty years is inevitable, driven by technological trends that are already in motion. 
                In this fascinating, provocative new book, Kevin Kelly provides an optimistic road map for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives.

                <strong>My Review:</strong>
                <br/>
                Kevin Kelly is a brilliant and creative author and journalist.
                In this book, he shares his expansive vision and futuristic wisdom about 12 inevitable trends in the world of technology. 
                Kelly points out how robots can change our future in a good way such that people won't have to do dangerous, physical, and difficult tasks because those are done easily by smart robots. 
                Autonomous vehicles will reduce the number of car accidents down to almost zero, and Artificial intelligence will make the healthcare service much more reliable with the help of self-tracking devices (wearables). 
                The emergence of clouds by different companies will create the cloud and every person can carry all human knowledge and information and access it at any time. 
                Of course, he believes modern technology can be used in criminal and non-ethical ways too but the benefits would be in favor of peace and improvement of human lives.

                <strong> My rating:</strong> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4899092077">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
                Nathaniel Branden explains why so many people say that romantic love is just not possible in today's world while
                he sees it as a pathway not only to extraordinary joy but also to profound self-discovery. 
                This book explores the nature of romantic love on many levels-the philosophical, the historical, the sociological, and the physiological. 
                <br/><br/>
                <strong>My Review:</strong>
                <br/>
                Dr Brandon is one of my favorite psychologists and authors. 
                I read this book after his masterpiece the Six Pillars of Self Esteem. 
                His view of love is very humanistic and natural. 
                He does not think that love is is something unattainable but he believes that we need to be ready for it. 
                He mentions some common patterns of unhealthy love and as I was expecting almost all of those are related to a person's self esteem and self confidence. 
                I think reading this book would help young people to recognize unhealthy behaviors in relationships and opens their eyes.

            <strong>My Review:</strong>

            <br/>
            This book is about common fallacies we face in our daily lives. 
            The author discusses 99 ways of thinking better and not following the illusions that have become norms in society. 
            Each mini essay is about 2 to 3 pages long and well-structured. 
            The author is not a university professor but uses many sources and scientific studies with proper citations. 
            The most significant aspect of the book is the author's use of simple language for demonstrating complicated concepts.

            The Psychology of Silicon Valley offers a revealing look inside the mind of world’s most influential industry and how the identity, culture, myths, and motivations of Big Tech are harming society.             
            <br><br><br><strong>My Review:</strong>
            <br />
            As a software engineer working at a start-up in Silicon Valley, this book gave me valuable insight. 
            The author pays good attention to the psychological issues of the most intelligent and successful individuals in the nation. 
            Lack of emotional intelligence and selfishness cause serious issues in the working environment. 
            Unhealthy competitions demand employees who work like machines with a limited sense of empathy for others. 
            Goal-oriented engineers and self-centered CEOs walk in the streets of the San Francisco Bay Area in front of hundreds of homeless people every day without even noticing them.

              by Johann Hari</a><br/>
              <strong> My rating:</strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4112921408"> 5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
              Award-winning journalist Johann Hari suffered from depression since he was a teenager.
              He was told that his problem was caused by a chemical imbalance in his brain. Later he began to investigate this question.           
              Across the world, Hari discovered social scientists who were uncovering the real causes—and they are mostly not in our brains, but in the way we live today.
             
            <br><br><strong>My Review:</strong>
            <br />
            This is an amazing book about human behaviors resulting from our lifestyle that might eventually cause depression in people in the modern world. Studies show that a large number of people, who suffer from depression, have a severe lack of ability to reason and think logically. Hari mentions interesting facts about our animal side and how disconnection from nature can cause depressed moods. Although, in my opinion, the author is a bit too much against medication therapy, some of the topics he says would help people who suffer from depression.

              In Sapiens, Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the 
              radical – and sometimes devastating – breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. 
            <br><br><br><strong>My Review:</strong>
            <br />
            I believe Sapians is a masterpiece and a must-read for whoever wants to know how homo-sepians evolved and human civilization developed for thousands or even millions of years. 
            The book is well-written and easy to follow. The author's analysis and explanations are based on scientific evidence and historical facts. 
            In Sepians, Harari emphasizes the importance of narratives and storytelling in shaping and strengthening human relations and establishing early civilizations. He analyzes the role of religions in communicating and expanding those stories and forming extensive groups of people having similar attitudes and sharing the same beliefs and behaviors. History shows us how cultures grew because of interaction between homo-sepians and even people gossiping played a crucial role in creating, telling, and repeating those stories over and over and fictional stories that helped them become united and function organically as societies and nationalities. In brief and in my opinion, the gist of this book is what differentiated human beings from other animals were the power of storytelling. Storytelling is what made homo-sepians the most dominant creatures on earth.

              Yuval Noah Harari's 21 Lessons for the 21st Century is a probing and visionary investigation into today's
              most urgent issues as we move into the uncharted territory of the future.
              <br><br><br><strong>My Review:</strong><br>
              One of the finest books I've ever read. Harari explains the most complex philosophical concepts in a
              simple
              and understandable language. His point of view on ideological and religious beliefs is completely neutral,
              fair, and based on logic, evidence, and scientific approach rather than prejudices.
              In this book, the author discusses 21 fundamental topics such as religion, education, politics, democracy,
              nationalism, technology, and so on. He argues the way people's lives are impacted by fixed ideas,
              mindsets, and schools of thought. Also, he points out how sepians evolved and how their evolution shaped
              society, individuals, and cultures.
              Harari's arguments and conclusions are based upon reality, science, and open-mindedness, and he defends
              the liberty, freedom, and dignity of a human being.

              A fascinating exploration of how computer algorithms can be applied to our everyday lives, helping to
              solve common decision-making problems and illuminate the workings of the human mind.
              <br><br><br><strong>My Review:</strong>
              <br>
              Decision-making is one of the most critical functions of our mind. In this book, the authors clearly show
              how peoples' minds are programmed. The whole idea of algorithm design is about how our minds process and
              the steps we use to overcome challenges. Psychology explains how humans' minds operate when it comes to
              tasks that are difficult but common. We need to solve a problem once by finding the proper steps, remember
              them, and use them any time we face the same or similar problems. This idea is how computers work.
              Computers are programmed to make our life easier by completing tasks faster as a result of the combination
              of the power of the mind and the functionality of microprocessors that use with multiple levels of
              software. Authors go over the most crucial concepts of data structures and algorithms like searching,
              sorting, optimizing, graphs, etc., and show how such ideas were born.
              Although the literature is fairly simple, smooth, and does not include too many technical words and
              phrases, its concepts can be somehow difficult for readers with no or limited background in computer
              science and mathematics.

              The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem is a psychology book written by Dr. Nathaniel Branden. Dr. Branden is known
              as the "father" of the Self-Esteem movement and this book is his most popular work.
              <br> <br><br> <br> <strong>My Review:</strong> <br>
              Everybody should read this book, especially people with low self-esteem. Most psychological disorders such
              as depression, anxiety, and anger come from a lack of self-esteem. During a person's mental development,
              most babies between the age of one and three years old received millions of signals from other people
              regarding their weaknesses. Because children make mistakes and others correct them, they think they are
              bad. In the next stages of development, as what Piage introduced as the preoperational, concrete, and
              formal operational stages, the bad feeling of a child must be recovered by positive messages from parents,
              friends, and the educational system. Otherwise, the person could suffer from a low-esteem.
              In this book, Dr. Brandon provides a scientific and empirical method for building one's self-esteem as an
              adult.
