            <p class="job-description">
              Minimalism is a theory based on valuing experiences rather than things.
              Minimalism philosophy teaches valuable ideals to live by, whether one chooses to follow the minimalist
              lifestyle or not. It challenges us to live a life with more meaning.

            <p class="job-description">
              According to Joshua Fields Millburn & Ryan Nicodemus,
              Minimalism is a tool that can assist you in finding freedom. Freedom from fear. Freedom from worry.
              Freedom from overwhelm. Freedom from guilt. Freedom from depression. Freedom from the trappings of the
              consumer culture we’ve built our lives around. Real freedom.

            <p class="job-description">
              The most common issues related to reducing the accumulation of belongings include: <br>
              Stress <br>
              Poor attention span <br>
              Impulsive buying <br>
              Overwhelming chaos around the home or workspace produces an additional anxiety, at the same time
              intervening with brain activity. Additionally, any space with way too many unnecessary things reduces
              motivation for work and encourages tiredness, unlike more sterile and clean-looking, well-lit rooms.

            <p class="job-description">
              By changing our expectations regarding material needs we also change our response to the commercially
              overblown world around us. When we need less, we simultaneously get rid of unnecessary pressure to keep up
              with the imposed consumerist trends.
              Minimalism offers a different outlook on consumption where only essentials and small
              quantities of personal belongings and clothes matter.

            <p class="job-description">
              Minimalism is about avoiding the unnecessary , it’s about simplicity, utility and elegance. It’s all about
              “LESS IS MORE” in terms of embracing the most of fewer things.
              The most common misconception is that minimalists “suffer” and “sacrifice” while having less things and
              less interesting experiences. Truth be told, it’s quite the opposite. True minimalists need only
              particularly selected items and they make the most of them, thus enriching (and not limiting) their
              experience.

            <p class="job-description">
              Minimalism is the intentional promotion of the things we most value and the removal of anything that
              distracts us from it. It is about focus, intentionality, and making the most of the one life we have been
              given.

              Minimalists own fewer possessions. As a result, their homes feel more peaceful, more calm, more spacious,
              and less stressful. You may not be able to declutter your entire home in one day,
              but you can make a little bit of progress.
              Try to remove one entire box of clutter from one room in your home. And then, notice the difference it

            <p class="job-description">
              Every physical possession in our field of vision results in visual clutter. Our eyes naturally gravitate
              to the things around us as we subconsciously scan our surroundings on a constant basis.
              Find one surface in your home that you can clear entirely and remove everything from it. Notice the clear
              surface. Now, imagine that feeling
              throughout your entire home.

              If you want to take one small step toward living more like a minimalist today, don’t buy a single
              nonessential item. Then, put that money into a savings account. Tomorrow, do the same thing. You’ll be

              Today, eliminate one obligation from your life that you do not enjoy or does not further your greatest
              passions and pursuits. Make the phone call, send the email, cancel the reservation… whatever you need to
              do. Reclaim your time to live the life you desire to live.

              It’s true, most minimalists own fewer clothes than other people. But not because owning fewer clothes is a
              sacrifice. Just the opposite in fact. Owning fewer clothes means everything hanging in my closet is my
              favorite. There’s nothing I’d rather wear than my favorite outfit every day.
              Today, wear your favorite outfit. Notice what you like about it. And then, imagine a world where you get
              to wear that every day.

              The greatest thing about minimalism is that it frees money, time, and energy for your greatest passions.
              This is the greatest benefit—a life lived focused on the pursuits that result in true happiness, joy,
              meaning, and fulfillment.
              So today, do one thing you love. And then, imagine yourself doing more of that every single day from here

              An unused item cluttering your home or your mind is a finite object. In a very practical yet philosophical

              infinite. The possibilities of how the cleared space might be used are completely at your disposal. When
              you continue to create more space, you become more flexible with your time, energy, and productivity.

              Whilst Buddhism is certainly one such source, possibly the most direct ancestor was Stoicism, an ancient
              Greek school of philosophy. Stoic ideas have greatly helped me refocus my ideas about the world by
              articulating wisdom that is true and valuable, regardless of time or culture.
              One of the key foundations of the Stoics is to learn to fully appreciate the things that we already have
              and
              be truly grateful for their presence. If we learn to thoroughly value what we already own, then we will
              ease
              our desire for more.

              In the modern world, full of advertising and sales, people are taught to always want
              more. The problem with this is what’s known in psychology cycles as hedonic adaption.
              Hedonic adaptation is the tendency of us mere humans to quickly return to a relatively stable level of
              happiness despite major recent positive or negative events or life changes. According to this theory, as
              we
              make more money, our expectations and desires rise in tandem.
              We work extremely hard
              to fulfill a desire, initially getting some satisfaction, but soon enough, we adapt to its presence and no
              longer find it as desirable as we once did. We end up caught in a loop of dissatisfaction with no

            <p class="job-description">
              Digital minimalism is about intentionally shaping your digital life around your values so you can feel
              good
              about the apps and tools you use on a daily basis.
              Digital minimalism is a way to not only clearly define what technologies you let into your life but how
              you use them.
              Digital minimalism is a philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number
              of carefully selected
              and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything
              else.

            <p class="job-description">
              Choice and intention. You’re still using technology, but only what you want and only in
              ways that connect to your values. <br>
              Optimizing the tools. What you allow into your life needs to work for you. This
              means separating the good from the bad. <br>
              Accepting you won’t be everywhere all the time. Tech companies survive on FOMO–the fear
              of missing out. But digital minimalists are happy to miss out on the things they know don’t bring value to
              their lives.

            <h3 class="mb-0">Digital Minimalism Principles</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              1. Digital minimalists recognize that cluttering their time and attention with too many
              devices, apps, and services creates an overall negative cost that can swamp the small benefits that each
              individual item provides in isolation.
              2. Digital minimalists believe that deciding a particular technology supports something they
              value is only the first step. To truly extract its full potential benefit, it’s necessary to think
              carefully about how they’ll use the technology.
              3. Digital minimalists derive significant satisfaction from their general commitment to being
              more intentional about how they engage with new technologies. This source of satisfaction is independent
              of the specific decisions they make and is one of the biggest reasons that minimalism tends to be
              immensely meaningful to its practitioners.

              In computing, minimalism refers to the application of minimalist philosophies and principles in the design
              and use of hardware and software. Minimalism, in this sense, means designing systems that use the least
              hardware and software resources possible.

            <p class="job-description">
              Minimalism is an extreme form of abstract art developed in the USA in the 1960s and typified by artworks
              composed of simple geometric shapes based on the square and the rectangle.
              Minimalism or minimalist art can be seen as extending the abstract idea that art should have its own
              reality and not be an imitation of some other thing.

            <h3 class="mb-0">The Medium</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              We usually think of art as representing an aspect of the real world or reflecting an experience such as an
              emotion or feeling. With minimalism, no attempt is made
              to represent an outside reality, the artist wants the viewer to respond only to what is in front of them.
              The medium, (or material) from which it is made, and the form of the work is the reality.

            <p class="job-description">
              The development of minimalism is linked to that of conceptual art. Both movements challenged the existing
              structures for making, disseminating and viewing art and
              argued that the importance given to the art object is misplaced and leads to a rigid and elitist art world
              which only the privileged few can afford to enjoy

            <p class="job-description">
              Aesthetically, minimalist art offers a highly purified form of beauty. It can also be seen as representing
              such qualities as truth (because it does not pretend to be anything other than what it is), order,
              simplicity and harmony.

            <p class="job-description">
              Donald Judd: <br>
              Donald Judd was an American artist, painter and sculptor who is credited with popularizing a lot of the
              principles of minimalist design. Though he never liked the term minimalism to describe his art, his use of
              geometric forms and simplistic design made Judd a contributor to the art movement nonetheless.<br><br>
              Carl Andre:<br>
              Another part of the group that began the New York movement of the 1960’s, Carl Andre helped to bring grid
              structures and a linear approach to sculptures. With simple visual elements in his approach to sculpture,
              he helped to further the new, more modern art genre that we know as minimal art today.<br><br>
              Dan Flavin: <br>
              Dan Flavin, also a New York sculptor who moved from abstract expressionism to a new style of art
              experience that helped this modern movement. Unique due to his use of fluorescent lights in structures,
              his minimalistic art is still looked at today as one of the leaders in the history of minimalism.
