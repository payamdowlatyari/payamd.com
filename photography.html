            <p class="job-description">
              Photography isn’t the only way to capture the world, but it certainly is one of the most effective.<br>
              Photography is the art of capturing light with a camera, usually via a digital sensor or film, to create
              an image. <br> With the right camera equipment, you can even photograph wavelengths of light invisible to
              the
              human eye, including UV, infrared, and radio.

            <p class="job-description">
              Photography, as we know it today, began in the late 1830s in France. <br>Joseph Nicéphore Niépce used a
              portable camera obscura to expose a pewter plate coated with bitumen to light. <br>This is the first
              recorded image
              that
              did not fade quickly. <br>
              Photography was only for professionals and the very rich until George Eastman started a company called
              Kodak in the 1880s.

            <p class="job-description">

              There are a number of photography genres that are very popular today. <br>These include portrait,

              architecture, fashion, food, sports, wildlife, macro, street, event and documentary photography.<br>
              Not every photo fits neatly into a single genre of photography. Sometimes, an image will straddle the
              line
              between two or more different types.

              A great photograph should have good light, subject, and composition – the three elements that matter the
              most in photography. <br> The photographer should have a strong vision, then express it in the most
              effective
              way possible.

            <p class="job-description">

              Exposure is the basic element of any photograph taken and recorded. <br>Essentially, it is exactly how
              it
              sounds, exposure is how much light your shot was exposed to, and this reflects on what is produced in
              your
              final image, be it on film, or more likely nowadays, digitally. <br>A photo can be “overexposed” (too
              bright),
              “underexposed” (too dark), or “properly exposed.”

            <p class="job-description">
              Every photograph has a point of interest—and that point should be clear to the
              viewer. <br>We look at photographs in much the
              same way we read text—from left to right
              and top to bottom in Western culture. <br>The
              viewer’s eyes should not roam aimlessly
              around the frame. They should be guided to
              the point of interest. <br>But that point should
              not always be in the center of the frame.
              Such shots can seem static, and thus boring.

            <h3 class="mb-0">Framing</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Because most of us hang pictures on the
              wall and peer through windows, we have a
              well-developed sense of frames. <br>But just as
              a hanging frame enhances a photograph, a
              frame element within the picture itself can
              enhance or emphasize the point of interest.<br>
              A “frame” in these terms is an object in the
              foreground that lends depth to the picture.<br>
              It might be a branch with leaves, the mouth
              of a cave, a window, a bridge or column, or
              a colorful doorway

            <p class="job-description">

              The white balance is how your camera registers light and gives your image/video a color temperature.
              It’s
              measured in Kelvin, with each light source’s hue having its own corresponding temperature. Mid-day light
              is usually around 5600 Kelvin (K), with a candle down on the “warm” end at 2000K, and dark shade on the
              “cool” end at 9000K.

            <h3 class="mb-0">The Rule of Thirds</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Imagine breaking an image down into thirds (both horizontally and vertically) so that you have 9 parts.
              With this grid in mind the ‘rule of thirds’ now identifies four important parts of the image that you
              should consider placing points of interest in as you frame your image. <br>
              It also gives you four ‘lines’ that are also useful positions for elements in your
              photo.
              The theory is that if you place points of interest in the intersections or along the lines that your photo
              becomes more balanced and will enable a viewer of the image to interact with it more naturally.

              original cameras did not even have a glass lens, though today we can say that most cameras include: a
              light-tight box, a glass lens, and a surface that captures light.

              plates, film – to the modern day with digital cameras and camera phones.

            <p class="job-description">
              The first camera was essentially a room with a small hole on one side wall. Light would pass through
              that hole, and since it's reflected in straight lines, the image would be projected on the opposite
              wall, upside down.
              It was not until the 17th century that the camera obscura became small enough to be portable. <br>Basic
              lenses to focus the light were also introduced around this time.

            <h3 class="mb-0">Three Fundamental Camera Settings</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              The three most important settings are called shutter speed, aperture, and ISO. All three of them control
              the brightness of your photo, although they do so in different ways. In other words, each brings its own
              “side effects” to an image. So, it’s a bit of an art to know exactly how to balance all three for a
              given
              photo. <br> <br>
              - Shutter speed: The amount of time your camera sensor is exposed to the world while taking a picture.<br>
              - Aperture: Represents a “pupil” in your lens that can open and close to let in different amounts of
              light.<br>
              - ISO: Technically a bit more complex, but similar to the sensitivity of film for taking pictures in
              different lighting conditions.

            <h3 class="mb-0">Shutter speed</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Shutter speed controls how long the shutter stays open when you take a picture. The longer the shutter
              stays open, the more light gets through to the camera’s sensor. A fast shutter speed is good for freezing
              action, while a longer shutter speed will blur motion. Long shutter speeds can give interesting effects,
              but usually require a tripod.

            <h3 class="mb-0">Aperture</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Aperture is the opening in your lens and controls how much light gets through to the camera’s sensor as
              well as the depth of field. Depth of field refers to the area surrounding the focal point of the image
              which remains sharp. A wider aperture (indicated by a lower f-number) lets more light through, but has a
              narrow depth of field. While a narrow aperture (indicated by a higher f-number) lets less light through,
              but has a wider depth of field. A wide aperture is great when you want to isolate your subject, but when
              you want the whole scene to be in focus, such as with group shots, you’ll need to use a narrow aperture.

            <h3 class="mb-0">ISO</h3>
            <p class="job-description">

              ISO controls the camera’s sensitivity to light. A low ISO setting means the camera will be less sensitive
              to light, while a higher ISO means it will be more sensitive to light. However, the quality of the image
              will decrease as the ISO increases and you may see 'noise' on the image with a higher ISO. An ISO setting
              of 100 to 200 is usually ideal when shooting outdoors during the day, but when shooting in low light
              situations, such as indoors or at night, a higher ISO of 400 to 800 or higher might be necessary.

            <p class="job-description">
              Traditional film photography uses a chemical process to expose and
              capture images. The camera lens and body allow a prescribed amount of
              light to come into contact with the film, which is basically a sheet of plastic
              that has been coated with a light sensitive chemical compound. Once the
              film is sufficiently exposed to light an invisible picture is formed. When the
              film is developed, other chemicals are applied and the image then becomes
              perceptible forming a negative image which then can be enlarged and
              printed on photographic paper

              lets the viewfinder use the main optical system.

            <p class="job-description">

              This camera is named for the reflexing mirror that allows you to frame
              the image through the lens prior to capturing the image. As light passes
              through the DSLR camera’s lens, it falls onto a reflexing mirror and then
              passes through a prism to the viewfinder. The viewfinder image corresponds
              to the actual image area. When the picture is taken the mirror reflexes,
              moves up and out of the way, allowing the open shutter to expose the
              digital image sensor, which captures the image.

            <p class="job-description">

              A mirrorless camera is a type of camera that works without a reflex mirror. Light passes through the lens
              directly to the digital sensor, which then displays your image on the camera's LCD screen, allowing you to
              adjust settings and preview your image before its shot.

            <p class="job-description">


              The lens is a sequence of complicated elements mostly made of glass, built
              to deflect and focus the light from the subject to the image sensor of a
              digital camera.<br>
              Aside from composing the image through your viewfinder, the first contact
              you have with the light from your subject is through the lens of your
              camera.

            <p class="job-description">

              There are several kinds of lenses
              available to the market but the most
              basic of these lenses are Telephoto,
              Wide Angle, Zoom and Prime. <br>They
              perform the same basic function of the
              lens: to reflect light from the subject and
              projects it to the image sensor of the
              camera or the film.<br> The difference
              among them is the way they transmit
              and refract light to the image sensor.

            <p class="job-description">
              Telephoto lenses are used to significantly magnify a subject at great
              distances.<br> A telephoto lens has a long focal distance, meaning that objects
              closer to the camera will appear slightly out of focus but objects at long
              range will be clear and precise.

              Wide-angle lenses use only a
              short focal length allowing
              photographers to concentrate the
              shot on the main subject but while

              A zoom lens is the type of lens
              which possesses the mechanical ability
              to alter its focal length. <br>It is also known
              as an optical zoom lens. Zoom lenses
              can provide variable focal lengths to the
              photographer, making it a productive
              professional tool. <br>It can alter its focal
              length from wide angle to standard and
              from there to zoom.

            <p class="job-description">

              The focal length of a prime lens is
              unalterable. It is also termed as a fixed lens due
              to this characteristic. <br>Prime lenses are generally
              manufactured with wider maximum apertures
              and the lens speed is faster as a result of that. <br>In
              darker conditions, wider apertures really come in
              handy as they can provide brighter pictures.<br>
              Besides, one possesses more control over the depth of field while he/she is
              using the wider apertures. Portrait photographers are the main users of the
              prime lenses.

            <p class="job-description">
              An f-stop is a camera setting that specifies the aperture of the lens on a particular photograph. It is
              represented using f-numbers. The letter “f” stands for focal length of the lens. <br>
              The lower the f/stop—the larger the
              opening in the lens—the less depth of field—the blurrier the background. The higher the f/stop—the smaller
              the opening in the lens—the greater the depth of field—the sharper the background.
